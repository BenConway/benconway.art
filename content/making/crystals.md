These images are close-up photos of some of my recent experiments in crystal growing. Who knew you could make stuff like this out of salt, ink, and baking soda?

This is a close-up photo of one of my first experiments---baking soda on a piece of clear plastic. I can't remember now if this one also had salt in it or not.

I dissolved the crystals again and put a piece of paper in the solution. As the water evaporated, the salt and baking soda crystals grew on the paper---mostly on the bottom side. I liked the way that looked, but then I tried staining the crystals with blue ink and liked that even more.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<br/>
After looking at the blue crystal images for a while, I decided to try an image processing experiment---putting the image on 2 layers in GIMP, flipping one layer upside down, and setting that layer's mode to 'Difference.' I really like how this one turned out.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

I also tried a variation on that process, using two different images instead of just flipping the same one upside down. I like zooming in on these images and looking for patterns that suggest visual art projects or stories, Rorschach-style.
