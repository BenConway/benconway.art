I'm an illustrator currently studying at <a href="https://cca.edu" target="_blank">California College of the Arts</a>. I have a specific interest in 3D scientific illustration,
especially astronomical illustration and space illustration.

Most of my work consists of 3D renderings. Some of my images are
created entirely from imagination to convey a new world. Other images
are created to technical specifications, to produce an accurate
rendition of a real spacecraft or object. In either case, I try to make my
images logically consistent so they are believable.

My objective with my artwork is to create a sense of wonder
and to convey knowledge. I want to explain science and show people how
interesting and exciting the world really is.

I work primarily with open-source software including Blender and Krita, but also have experience with
Adobe Creative Cloud.
