Ben Conway is an illustrator, skilled at using 3D modeling and traditional media to create visually interesting and scientifically accurate images of a variety of subjects, including spacecraft and astronomical objects.

Ben has had an illustration-related internship at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
