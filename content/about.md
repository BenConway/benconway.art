I'm an illustrator specializing in scientific and technical illustration.

My objective with my artwork is to create a sense of wonder
and to convey knowledge. I want to explain science and show people how
interesting and exciting the world really is.

Some of my images are created entirely from imagination to convey a new world. Other images are created to exact technical specifications, to produce an accurate rendition of a real spacecraft or object. In either case, I try to make my images logically consistent so they are believable.

Most of my work consists of 3D renderings. I primarily use open-source software such as <a href="https://blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a>, and I try to find ways to combine this with traditional media such as acrylic painting.
