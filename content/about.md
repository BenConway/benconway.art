Ben Conway is an illustrator with the mind of a scientist. He has been working with 3D modeling software since 2010, and has years of experience working with traditional drawing techniques.

Ben spends a lot of his spare time reading up on new scientific results and trying to develop a working knowledge of fields that he's unfamiliar with. This can range from reading books to gain a better understanding of advanced physics, to conducting his own chemistry experiments to develop a new photographic process. With this knowledge of science and technology, Ben can interpret information and develop ways of depicting complex concepts---either to the general public, or to experts in different fields.

Ben has had an internship at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he interacted directly with the team planning NASAâ€™s upcoming Psyche mission to create illustrations for mission planning documents. He was able to clarify discussions between team members several times, and his understanding of Hall-effect thrusters was considered impressive.

In addition to illustrating, Ben likes to create electronic ambient music, write science fiction stories, and go hiking.

Ben is currently available for freelance work.
