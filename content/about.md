I'm currently studying illustration at California College of the
Arts. I have a specific interest in scientific illustration,
especially astronomical and space travel subjects.

I work primarily with open-source software including Blender and
Krita, but also have experience with Adobe Creative Cloud. I also work
traditionally with acrylics and watercolors.

Most of my work consists of 3D renderings, but recently I have begun
working with 2D techniques and experimenting with integrating 3D and
2D media.
