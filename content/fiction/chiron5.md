We're orbiting Kapteyn b. I'm looking at the photos coming in from the Chiron's cameras and the orbiters we've released. Kapteyn b is a world of contrasts. The side facing Kapteyn's Star is a sun-baked volcanic desert. The other side is a dark, frozen wasteland. In the middle, there's a place where life can just barely survive.

The other day I was having lunch in the cafeteria. I looked at the map and saw that the Chiron was flying over the desert---six hundred kilometers below us was an environment that would make Earth's deserts look like a walk in the park. And there I was, sitting in a 22-Celsius room eating tamales.

A couple of hours later I was back at my desk and I checked the orbit plot again. We were over the dark side now. Kapteyn b's dark side is colder and darker than Antarctica in winter. And I was several hundred kilometers overhead, in an office that wouldn't have looked out of place at a research university or newsroom on Earth.

I checked the map again before going to bed. We'd circled Kapteyn b several times over the course of the day, and at that moment we were flying over the temperate zone. Hundreds of kilometers below us, there was a biosphere filled with lifeforms that no one had ever seen before. With excitement like that, is it any wonder I had trouble sleeping?
