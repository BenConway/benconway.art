Sarah and Nathan had decided to build a child.

"I've cleared off the table," Nathan said.

"OK, great." Sarah set the down the big cardboard box, and they both started taking the brightly-colored plastic pieces out of it.

At the bottom of the box, there was a tool kit and an instruction booklet---fifty pages of semi-comprehensible cave drawings. Sarah looked at the first few pages, and started snapping together the main frame. This was the easier part---things would be considerably more challenging when it came time to assemble the soul.

They'd both watched groups of friends doing this, but they'd never done it themselves before.

They looked at the charts in the back of the instruction booklet. They listed the different gearing configurations and chemical variations for the soul, and the effect they would have on the resulting child.

"I think something like this?" Sarah pointed at one of the spots on the chart. It had small images of an airplane, a boat, and a peace symbol. She didn't know exactly what that meant---probably no one else did either---but it seemed promising.

"That looks good for the gearing. What about this for the chemicals?" Nathan pointed at an image of a smiley face wearing a beret, next to some musical notes and a flower.

"Sounds good."

Sarah installed the tiny gears, while Nathan opened up the packet of alien bacteria and mixed it with warm water.

The gears began turning, and the child opened their eyes with a click.

"What should we name them?" asked Nathan.

"Hmm. Some kind of color, maybe."

"Green? Aqua?"

"Aqua. We'll name them Aqua."

Aqua began walking around the apartment.

"What is this?" they asked, pointing to a potted plant.

"It's a flower," said Nathan.

"Flower." Aqua walked over to a shelf and pointed at a model ship. "What is this?"

"It's a ship. Well, a model of one."

"Model ship." Aqua went to the window and looked outside.

They went to the art museum when Aqua was about four hours old.

"I like this one," Aqua said, pointing at a landscape painting from the Dutch Golden Age.

They went through the rooms slowly, and in no particular order. After a couple of hours, Aqua stopped in front of a painting of sailboats.

"I want to learn to sail," they said.

So they all went to the lake, and Nathan taught Aqua how to sail his boat. They learned quickly---unsurprising, since they mentally aged about four and a half years during the three-hour lesson.

"What's that?" Aqua pointed at a building on top of a nearby hill.

"It's an old barn," Sarah said. "We could hike out there, if you want."

"Yes."

So they hiked up the trail and explored the abandoned barn.

Aqua matured after 16 hours.
<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you," they said. "I'll keep in touch."
<br/>
<br/>

"Good! We look forward to hearing from you," Sarah said.

Aqua left, and Nathan and Sarah began cleaning up the apartment.
