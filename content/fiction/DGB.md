Sam stood on the roof of his building, getting ready to launch a balloon.

He looked out over the Complex. The red sunset cast long shadows across the broken-down machinery and empty buildings. Even at this time of day, the air was still uncomfortably warm. Some electrical wires buzzed in the distance, but aside from that, the Complex was still.

A faint touch of wind rang the chimes attached to the balloon he was holding, drawing his attention back towards it.

He made one final inspection of the balloon's cargo. The plants in the containers all looked healthy and green. The metal framework that held the containers seemed perfectly sturdy. And the balloon itself was inflated and tugging upwards.

He took a moment to consider the vehicle as a whole. It had taken him months to build the structure. And almost as long to select the right kind of plants---plants that had been native here, before the Complex had been built and the surrounding area had turned into a desert. Hidden all throughout the vehicle were details he'd struggled mightily with, day and night.

This was actually the second one he'd built---he'd had to give up on the first one after a long and difficult struggle with design flaws and material issues. But this one had gone OK---he'd learned enough the first time around to get it right the second time. And now here it was, ready to go.

Ready to float across the desert, and parachute down somewhere. And hopefully make the world a little better, like those little garden-robots someone had left here in the Complex about a year ago.

He got ready to cut the ropes holding the balloon down, but was stopped by a sharp surge of doubt.

_Will this do any good?_

He looked out at the cracked, disintegrating grayness of the Complex. He looked out at the immense, unnatural desert. He looked at the vehicle he'd built---it was about as small as he was, not counting the balloon itself. This felt like putting a drop of water on the pavement and watching it evaporate from the harsh heat.

He cut the anchor ropes and watched the balloon ascend into the sky.

The balloon drifted along, several thousand feet above the desert floor---at an altitude Sam had carefully calculated. The balloon had to drift, but not too far. And it had to stay low enough that the plants it carried wouldn't be harmed.

A few airships detected it on their radar, and steered around it. A solitary nomad on the ground spotted it through binoculars. Aside from that, no one really paid it much attention.

The plants in the terracotta containers continued to grow, oblivious to the fact that they were flying. Some leaves and flower petals fell over the edge, fluttering all the way down to the ground.

The automatic timer popped the balloon, and the garden parachuted to Earth. It landed about half a mile from a long-abandoned oil field.

Before the Desertification, this area had been pretty verdant. Then it had turned into a parched wasteland. The climate was returning to normal, but the area was still barren and mostly devoid of plants.

Until, thanks to Sam, a bunch of them parachuted down from the balloon.

The wind stirred the leaves. The wind chimes rang. And some plants released seeds that landed in the soil nearby.

Some time later, the seeds germinated. Their leaves grew outward to catch the sunlight. Their roots tunneled downward.

A few years after the balloon had landed, there was a ragged patch of greenery surrounding its landing point. An oasis of life and beauty.
