_(This is Part 2 of the story. Part 1 is <a
href="/fiction/desert-gardens-expanded/"> here.</a>)_

Sam stood on the roof of his building, getting ready to launch a balloon.

He looked out over the Complex. The red sunset cast long shadows across the broken-down machinery and empty buildings. Even at this time of day, the air was uncomfortably warm. Some electrical wires buzzed in the distance, but aside from that, the Complex was still.

He made one final inspection of the balloon's cargo. The plants in the containers all looked healthy and green. The metal framework that held the containers seemed perfectly sturdy. A faint breeze rang the wind chimes that were suspended from the framework. And the balloon itself was inflated and tugging upwards.

It had taken him months to build this thing. And almost as long to select the right kind of plants---plants that had been native here, before the Complex had been built and the surrounding area had turned into a desert. Hidden all throughout the vehicle were details he'd contended with for many days and nights.

This was actually the second one he'd built---he'd had to give up on the first one after a long struggle with design flaws and material issues. But this one had gone OK---he'd learned enough the first time around to get it right the second time. And now here it was, ready to go.

Ready to float across the desert, and parachute down somewhere. And hopefully make the world a little better, like those little garden-robots someone had left here in the Complex about a year ago.

He got ready to cut the ropes holding the balloon down, but was stopped by a sharp surge of doubt.

_Will this do any good?_

He looked out at the cracked, disintegrating grayness of the Complex. He looked out at the immense, unnatural desert.

Then he looked at the vehicle he'd built. It was tiny. _He_ was tiny.

This felt like putting a single drop of water on the pavement and watching it evaporate from the harsh heat.

He cut the anchor ropes and watched the balloon ascend into the sky.

The balloon drifted along, several thousand feet above the desert floor---at an altitude Sam had carefully calculated. The balloon had to drift, but not too far. And it had to stay low enough that the plants it carried wouldn't be harmed.

A few airships detected it on their radar, and steered around it. A solitary nomad on the ground spotted it through binoculars. Aside from that, no one really paid it much attention.

The plants in the terracotta containers continued to grow, oblivious to the fact that they were flying. Some leaves and flower petals fell over the edge and fluttered all the way down to the ground.

The automatic timer popped the balloon, and the garden parachuted Earthward. It landed about half a mile from a long-abandoned oil field.

Before the Desertification, this area had been pretty verdant. Then it had turned into a parched wasteland. The climate was returning to normal, but the area was still barren and mostly devoid of plants.

Until Sam's miniature garden fell from the sky, thumping softly against the dry ground and settling in place at a slight tilt.

The wind stirred the leaves. The wind chimes rang. And some plants released seeds that landed in the soil nearby.

Some time later, the seeds germinated. Their leaves grew outward, to catch the sunlight. Their roots tunneled downward, and found water.

A few years after the balloon had landed, there was a ragged patch of greenery surrounding its landing point. An oasis of life and beauty.

What's Real:
</p>

+ High-altitude balloons are used for scientific research, but people also build and launch them as a hobby.
+ Things generally don't work the first time you build them, especially if you're learning new skills. But you should keep trying anyway.
+ Reintroducing native plants into damaged landscapes is an important part of environmental restoration. Even a small garden can have a positive effect.
