It was a quiet Saturday evening. Roger was sitting in the armchair doing a Sudoku puzzle, and Deer was laying on the floor reading.

There was a gentle buzz from the servos in one of Deer's arms as he turned the page. He hadn't used to read all that much---his old robotic arm didn't have the dexterity to turn pages or operate an e-reader, so Roger had included 'ability to turn pages' in the design specs for the new ones.

"Now that I can read books, I should try it. What should I read?" Deer had asked.

Roger had given him a few recommendations, including some of his favorite books, and now Deer was working his way through the list.

Deer closed the book and set it aside.

"What's wrong? Didn't you like it?" asked Roger.

"Ish. It didn't really resonate with me," Deer said.

"Why not?"

"I don't know, something about the way it was written seemed too complicated."

Deer picked up another book from the pile. Out of curiosity, Roger took the discarded one and flipped through it.

_Seems fine to me..._ If anything, it was better than he'd remembered it. _I guess Deer's wrong._

"Oh, now this is a good one," Deer said.

Roger looked at the title. He remembered that book---it was terrible. He'd only put it on the list to convince Deer that not all books were good.

"Wait, you _like_ that stuff?"

"Huh? Yeah, don't you?"

"No, I don't. I don't really see how anyone could..." All the critics had given it terrible reviews.

"But I really like it. At least, so far---maybe it gets worse later?"

"No, it's equally bad all the way through."

"Or equally good, from my perspective."

"Hmm." Perspective. "I guess it's because your brain is so different from mine."

"That makes sense. The book doesn't just exist on its own. The reader brings something to it."

That was true. Now Roger found himself getting a bit annoyed with the critics who'd reviewed the book as if their judgements were objective facts.

Deer put on his headphones to listen to some dubstep. Roger picked up a couple of books from Deer's did-not-finish pile and started reading one of them.
