Rahas stood in the makeshift laboratory, looking at the patterns on the oscilloscope screen.

_Something's not right..._

_Something's still wrong..._

_I'm still not working properly..._

They looked down at the switchboard on their chest. It was supposed to integrate the signals from the different parts of their mind, but it wasn't. At least, not correctly.

They looked over at the grimy sheet of graph paper, and at the official wiring diagram next to it.

_There's no way that's right._

_This is all wrong._

_That diagram can't possibly be correct._

They'd been trying to map their internal wiring, but the results they got never seemed to match with the official diagram. Hence all the erasures and crossed-out conclusions on the graph paper.

They erased yet another part of it and then moved the cables around on their switchboard. A bolt of fear zipped up from their hindbrain, passed through their switchboard and electronics, and then fanned out into the different parts of their consciousness.

They checked the diagram. Yep, what had just happened was _supposed_ to be impossible.

They walked through the warehouse. It was filled with spare parts, and books, and a lot of junk. And none of it helped Rahas at all.

They walked to the end of an aisle. There was a bin sitting there with a bunch of reference manuals in it. They started looking through it, not really expecting much.

_Reference Manual---Series 90, Type C._

_Type C? What's that mean?_

_What is Type C?_

_I know I'm a Series 90, but I didn't know there were different types of Series 90._

They flipped through the pages. At the back of the book, there was a diagram of the switchboard connections for Series 90-C.

It looked nothing like the Series 90 switchboard diagram they'd been using. Everything was in a different place.

_Maybe that explains it._

_This might be the answer._

_If my switchboard is laid out differently, that would explain why I can't wire myself up according to the other diagram._

They dug through the bin and found another reference manual---this one listed the switchboard configurations for Types A, B, C, and D. They'd tried Type A already---it matched the other diagram they'd been using---so that left 3 configurations to test.

Rahas pulled all of the cables out of their switchboard. Their mind became foggy---the 3 parts of it were now totally disconnected. Their body no longer felt like a part of them. They felt no emotion. Their eyes seemed distant, like they were cameras broadcasting a TV show from somewhere far away. They watched dispassionately as the hands in front of them picked up a cable.

Once the cable was connected, they started to feel some emotion---a vague sense of expectation. It grew stronger and more complex as more cables were connected. It became a sense of hope---hope that they might finally be figuring out who they were, and how they worked.

The hands plugged in another cable, and suddenly Rahas felt like the hands were their own. They picked up another cable and plugged it in---they regained their connection to their legs, just like the diagram said they would. One by one, the different parts of their mind and body came together. They were now Rahas, a unified being, not just a bunch of independent thought processes and sensory inputs that happened to be in the same physical place.

_Well, that's certainly a relief._ A clean and fresh sense of relief---finally, they understood themself.

They stashed the reference manual in their storage compartment. There were practical reasons to hold onto it, but it was also just nice to know that you had something that described you accurately.
