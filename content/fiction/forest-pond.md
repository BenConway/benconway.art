<br/>

There's a small pond in the center of the woods, with traces of a stone foundation nearby. A frog sits on a fallen tree. A few birds fly past.

No humans have been here for a hundred years. The closest town is Rutherford Junction, sixty miles away at the edge of the wilderness. It's not much of a town---ten houses, a general store, one paved road, a tiny park, and a very small library.

Three people arrive in the town, carrying an assortment of high-tech equipment. One of them checks a map and points into the forest.

<br/>

They set up camp near the old foundation. One of them opens up a metal suitcase and takes out a streamlined device with round windows on the front and propellers on the back---a mini-submarine.

Someone else uses a long cable to connect it to a laptop. Then the third person drops the device into the water.

The pond is unusually deep. The mini-submarine turns on its floodlights and circles around a few times, surprising some fish.

Then it descends all the way to the silty bottom of the pond. The operators intently watch the video it's sending back.

After a brief search, they find what they're looking for. It isn't obvious at first---but as the submarine goes closer to investigate, the image on the laptop screen becomes unmistakable: a stone cylinder covered with intricate carvings.

<br/>
A hundred years earlier, Barbara finished carving the last tree into the surface of the cylinder. She stepped back to get a better view.
<br/>
<br/>

_It's done._

51 plants, 44 animals, the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. A microcosm of the surrounding forest, carved in local stone.

She put away her carving tools and went to open that letter she'd gotten.

---
<br/>

She left in a hurry---no time to pack, beyond the most basic essentials. The carving would have to stay---there was no way she could take it with her.

_But I can't just leave it here._ Someone would steal it, and probably destroy it. No one cared about her sculptures.

_Even if no one ever sees it again, I have to keep it safe somehow._

_I could bury it..._ No she couldn't, she didn't have time.

Then she went outside, and there was the pond.

---
<br/>
The carving made a big splash and sank to the bottom. Barbara watched the ripples in the water for a moment, and then made tracks to Rutherford Junction.

Some people came a few years later and emptied out the house, but they didn't find the carving---just some preparatory sketches.

After a few decades, the house collapsed.

A few decades after that, one of the preparatory sketches was found, and purchased by the Central Museum.

Then some people started to wonder where the carving itself could have ended up, and decided to go look for it.

<br/>
Getting it up to the surface will be a challenge, but they'll manage after a few attempts. Then they'll pack it inside a special container and carry it out of the forest. It will be flown across the ocean to the Central Museum to be cleaned up and restored.
<br/>
<br/>

Then it will travel the world, being exhibited in places that Barbara never even dreamed of. And after about five years, it will be returned to Rutherford Junction for permanent display in the library.
