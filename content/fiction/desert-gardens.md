The desert was a barren expanse of sun-baked ground. About every fifteen miles there was a cluster of crumbling houses. It was hard to tell the abandoned houses from the inhabited ones.

Near the middle of the desert there was a tiny pond. A few plants grew around it. Those were the only green things for miles.

An aircraft flew in over the mountains, circled the pond once, and landed. A ramp extended and two people got out.

They sat by the pond, bending wire and cutting wood. Slowly, a little vehicle took shape.

In the middle of the vehicle, they put a clay pot with a single plant growing in it. One of them put a glass dome on top of that, to keep in moisture and shield the plant from the harsh environment.

They flew on after two days, leaving a herd of the tiny machines behind them.

The wind blew. Hesitantly, the first of the vehicles started to move. The others twitched and started moving too.

They rolled out into the desert. Climbing dunes, crossing valleys, carrying their plants and keeping them safe.

One rolled through a cluster of houses and ran into a rock, flipping over and breaking apart.

Sam bent down and picked up the plant that it carried. It had just blossomed---the flower was smaller than his fingernail.

He took the plant into his house and put it on the windowsill.

For the first time in his life, he felt a sense of peace.
