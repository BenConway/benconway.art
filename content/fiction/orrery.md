The sun rose over the mountain, illuminating the light fog that filled the valley.

Ramet and Seja walked along the path that led up the hill, whistling together. They were pulling a small wagon filled with vegetables---the way they'd been doing, five days a week, for the past six years.

"There's the monument," Seja said. "We're halfway to Town."

"It looks different," said Ramet.

Seja looked at it for a long moment. She saw what was wrong.

"The orrery's stopped turning."

"The what?"

"Orrery. The thing on the top. Like a miniature solar system."

"So it's broken. It's old---it must have worn out."

"I bet we could fix it..."

"We don't have time. We've got to get to the market and sell these vegetables."

"We'll have time after that, though," Seja said. "Let's try it."

---

After they had sold all the vegetables, they picked up a wagonload of books at the library.

"So we know how to fix it," Seja explained.

Then they returned to the monument. They climbed the hill and navigated through the overgrown garden.

"Lots of vegetables growing here," Ramet observed.

"Cool. Let's get to work!" Seja was already climbing up one of the columns to get a closer look at the orrery. Ramet was more hesitant, but gradually gained the confidence to climb up with her.

---

"OK, I see the problem." Ramet bent over the mechanism. "This gear shaft has worn out completely."

"So we'll need to replace it," said Seja.

"With what? We don't have any spare parts. And we can't buy any parts from the gear factory because we don't have enough money."

"I bet we could make a replacement part out of a coathanger. Go get one."

---

It still didn't work.

"It doesn't make sense," Ramet said. "All the gears here are turning fine, but then those ones over there don't turn."

"Hmm." Seja took a magnifying glass out of her pocket and began inspecting the gear train.

"I've checked already---there's nothing jamming it."

Seja stopped and took a closer look.

"Well, in a sense, there is 'nothing' jamming it." She pointed. "There's a missing gear."

"So now we have to find it."

"It probably just fell on the ground somewhere."

"Where, though? How are we going to find a tiny gear lying _somewhere_ in this area?"

Seja got down on her hands and knees and began looking. _It can't have gotten too far, it must have just fallen out right here somewhere..._ After about ten minutes she found it---unfortunately it had gotten stepped on at some point, and the delicate metal had been mangled beyond repair.

---

The next day, they took another wagonload of vegetables from their neighbors into Town for the market.

Then they went back to the Monument. They couldn't really figure out what to do now. Seja just looked at the orrery and tried to figure out how to fix it, but couldn't come up with any ideas. Ramet walked around in the overgrown garden, picking carrots---at least it was something to do. He'd been carrying vegetables from farms into Town for most of his life, and it looked like he'd be doing it for the rest of his life. The orrery had been a diversion from the produce transportation business, but now it looked like they'd never be able to fix it.

_If only gears grew in this garden instead of carrots_, he thought.

---

The day after that, Ramet went out early in the morning. He left a note for Seja: _I'll be back at noon. I know how to fix the orrery._

He was indeed back at noon.

"So what's this all about?" Seja asked.

"Follow me."

They walked to the Consolidated Universal Gear Company, Inc.

"Can we get a replacement for this gear?" asked Ramet.

"Sure! Looks like part number 45-0062. Give me a moment... here's a matching gear," the person behind the counter said.

"Thank you!" Ramet handed them some money, then took the gear and walked out of the shop.

"How'd you get that money?" asked Seja.

"I sold all the carrots I picked yesterday."

"Oh! I didn't even think of that."

"It took me a while to figure it out. I kept ignoring the vegetables because we couldn't use them to solve the problem directly. And I kept ignoring the Gear Company because I assumed we couldn't pay for anything..."

"But combine the vegetables and the Gear Company..."

"Exactly. Combine the two things you're ignoring and you'll get a solution."

---

They installed the gear and started the orrery. It worked.

"We did it! We're a team!" Ramet said.

"A very good team, too."

They watched as the stars came out one by one. Tomorrow they'd have to take another wagonload of vegetables to the market, just like they always did.

But now the orrery worked again.
