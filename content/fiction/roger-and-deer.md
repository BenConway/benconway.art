Roger was abruptly awakened by Deer's loud electronic dance music, followed by the sound of his hooves as he walked out into the kitchen. Roger reached toward the nightstand to grab his earplugs, accidentally knocking his alarm clock to the floor and setting it off.

_Great start to the day._

He got up.

----------------
<br/>
Deer opened the refrigerator with his robotic arm and began packing his lunch&mdash;six jars of peanut butter, which he loaded into his saddlebags. The robotic arm jammed a few times, he thumped it with his nose to get it unstuck.

His favorite song came on, and he began tapping his hooves and twitching his tail in time with the music.

"Can you turn it down?" Roger shouted.

Deer nuzzled the volume control but that just made it louder. He tried pressing it against the wall to hit the pause button, that didn't work. _Come on, there's got to be some way to do this..._

"Never mind, it's not worth the trouble," Roger said.

"Sorry about that."

-------------------
<br/>
Roger arrived at the electronics shop and went to the back room to continue organizing their stock of components. At least here at work things were quiet.

He didn't know how Deer's coworkers handled the music. They probably didn't mind. The factory where Deer worked was loud enough that the music probably wasn't audible outside of his office.

Roger sifted through a box of speakers, checking to make sure they were all the same type.

_Hmm. Interesting..._

He scribbled a quick note.

-------------------
<br/>
He got home a couple of hours before Deer did&mdash;Deer usually took a walk in the park after work. So Roger had plenty of time.

He'd drawn up the schematic on the subway, it was a fairly simple matter. They'd had all the parts in stock.

He dumped out the paper bag onto his desk and plugged in his soldering iron.

--------------------
<br/>
Deer got home around seven o'clock, percussive electronic sounds still blasting from his music player.

"I made something for you!" Roger held up his handiwork. It was a modified music player with extra-large buttons, and headphones shaped to fit Deer's ears.

"Wow, groovy! Thank you!"

Deer unplugged his old music player. Roger helped him move the memory card into the new one and put it on.

"So how is it?"

"Fabulous! I wish they'd had you design this robotic arm I have to use."

The robotic arm was really poorly designed. Roger took a closer look at it.

"You know, I bet I could build you a better one. I'll get started on that once I sweep the apartment."

"I can sweep the apartment. You've helped me, I should return the favor."

----------------
<br/>
So Roger sat in his room, enjoying the quiet and designing a new robotic arm. Deer swept the apartment, his tail still twitching in time with the music that no one else had to listen to.
