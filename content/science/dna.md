This is an illustration about the discovery of the structure of DNA, and all of the evidence that had to be built up to make that discovery. It wasn't just a simple matter of one or two people figuring something out. First, Oswald Avery discovered that genetic information was carried by DNA---this was the foundational discovery that others built on. Then Alexander Todd discovered that the DNA molecule had a repeating structure of sugar and phosphate compounds. Erwin Chargaff discovered that certain components of the DNA molecule occurred at the same proportions relative to each other. Wilkins and Franklin discovered that the molecule was a helix or spiral. Models were proposed to explain the DNA structure but didn't fit the data, Linus Pauling's proposed model can be seen lying in the background. Finally, scientist Jerry Donohue suggested an alternate form of the molecules to use in the model, at which point Watson and Crick discovered the now-famous double helix structure.
