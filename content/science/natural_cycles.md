This is an illustration of the Earth's nitrogen, water, and carbon
cycles. Reservoirs (places where material accumulates) are indicated
with letters, processes that exchange material between reservoirs are
indicated with numbers.

 Nitrogen:

 A. Atmosphere.

1. Nitrogen fixation by bacteria.

2. Nitrogen fixation by lightning.

3. Nitrification by bacteria.

 D. Soil.

4. Denitrification by bacteria.

5. Assimilation of nitrogen into plants (B.)

6. Nitrogen return to soil through decomposition.

7. Nitrogen consumption by animals (C.)

8. Nitrogen return to soil through decomposition.

9. Ammonification.



 Carbon:

10. Exchange of carbon between the ocean (F) and the atmosphere (A.)

11. Photosynthesis.

 B. Plants.

12. Plant respiration.

13. Decomposition.

14. Carbon consumption by animals (C.)

15. Animal respiration.

16. Decomposition.

 D. Soil.

17. Microbial respiration.



 Water:

 A. Atmosphere.

18. Precipitation.

19. Uptake into plants (B.)

20. Evapotranspiration.

21. Groundwater infiltration.

 G. Groundwater.

22. Surface runoff.

 F. Oceans, lakes, and streams.

 E. Snowpack.

23. Snowmelt runoff.

24. Groundwater flow.

25. Evaporation.

 A. Atmosphere.

26. Condensation.
