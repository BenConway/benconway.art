_There is strong evidence that various psychological exercises can have a powerful effect on reducing prejudice. This article summarizes my understanding of some scientific papers I've read about the concept of prejudice reduction._

_A good introduction to the concept can be found in_ <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/top_10_strategies_for_reducing_prejudice">this article.</a>

_These articles have been peer-reviewed, but science is a process of change and improvement---the understanding of this subject may change with future research._

<br/>
A certain amount of psychological research has been performed in search of a one-shot intervention that reduces bias for extended periods of time ("bias vaccine.") It seems unlikely to me that such an intervention could be found, because other skills and abilities usually don't work like this. If someone learned to play an instrument and then went for months or years without practicing, they would be unlikely to perform well in a concert.

I suggest searching for prejudice reduction activities that can be self-applied repeatedly ("anti-bias exercise.") Then, even if the exercise's individual components only reduce bias for short time periods they will still add up to a long-term effect. Even short-term bias reduction could be a powerful tool if used properly, such as performing a bias-reduction exercise before making a hiring or promotion decision.

<p style="text-align: center;">Facial Feedback.</p>

Smiling while viewing images of people that one is implicitly biased against measurably reduces implicit bias later on. This effect was studied by Tiffany A. Ito et. al, and described in the article "The Influence of Facial Feedback on Race Bias", published in _Psychological Science_ in 2006. You can read it <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01694.x">here.</a>

<br/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Novel Category Combination.</p>

This method involves thinking of 5 combinations of characteristics that go contrary to stereotypes (examples from the research paper include "gay priest" and "male midwife.") The technique appears to reduce _all_ forms of prejudice, not just prejudice against a specific group. It has been shown to be effective outside of a laboratory setting, even in an area that had experienced recent ethnic conflict.

This image was based on the paper "Tolerance by Surprise: Evidence for a Generalized Reduction in Prejudice and Increased Egalitarianism through Novel Category Combination", by Milica Vasiljevic and Richard J. Crisp. The paper was published in _PLoS One_ in 2013, and you can read it <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057106">here.</a>

<br/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Vicarious Intergroup Contact.</p>

Watching videos of one's own group interacting positively with another group reduces prejudice towards the other group. This effect is strengthened when an authority figure of some kind expresses a positive opinion of the interaction. This effect has been studied for some time.

The paper I referred to was "Vicarious intergroup contact and the role of authorities in prejudice reduction", by Angel Gomez and Carmen Huici, published in the _Spanish Journal of Psychology_ in 2008.

<br/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Circadian Rhythm.</p>

Implicit biases have been shown to vary in strength throughout the day. They are weakest around 8-11 AM, and become more pronounced throughout the day, likely because of exhaustion of cognitive resources---as you grow tired, it becomes harder to think clearly.

This image was based on the paper "Implicit Associations Have a Circadian Rhythm", by Jonathan R. Zadra and Dennis R. Proffitt. It was published in _PLoS One_ in 2014, and you can read it <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110149">here.</a>

<br/>
<p style="text-align: center;">Self-Affirmation.</p>

People are less biased when they feel good about themselves. Stress, anxiety, and fear contribute to biased thinking. So for a prejudice-reduction attempt to be successful, it needs to be a positive experience for everyone involved.

For this image, I referred to the article "Self-Affirmation and Prejudice Reduction: When and Why", by Constantina Badea and David K. Sherman. It was published in _Current Directions in Psychological Science_ in 2018, and can be found <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721418807705">here.</a> I also referred to the article "Racial Anxiety" (Godsil and Richardson, Iowa Law Review, 2017), and Rodolfo Mendoza-Denton's 2011 article in <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/top_10_strategies_for_reducing_prejudice">Greater Good Magazine.</a>
