How 3D Modeling Works
</p>
3D modeling is different from most other illustration techniques. Rather than creating an image directly, it more closely resembles creating a sculpture and then photographing it. This allows for a level of flexibility and adjustability that's difficult to match with any other medium. I primarily use <a href="https://www.blender.org">Blender.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Consider the following image, the cover for my album <a href="https://benconway.bandcamp.com/releases">Chess for Dogs:</a>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Suppose we decided that the cactus and musical note should trade places. This is easily accomplished by simply selecting and moving them:
<br/>
<br/>
<img class="centered" src="/img/demo-1.png" width=500></img>

<br/>
<br/>
This puts the cactus against a black background, which we might not like. It's easy to simply change the background color...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img class="centered" src="/img/demo-2.png" width=500></img>

<br/>
<br/>
... but that interferes with the chessboard pattern, so we might decide instead to change to color of the musical note and cactus.
<br/>
<br/>
<img class="centered" src="/img/demo-3.png" width=500></img>

<br/>
<br/>
We can also adjust the shapes of objects easily, for instance we could lower the top of the pop-top camper van and adjust the chess piece.
<br/>
<br/>
<img class="centered" src="/img/demo-4.png" width=500></img>

<br/>
<br/>
With similar ease, we can change the lighting...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img class="centered" src="/img/demo-5.png" width=500></img>

<br/>
<br/>
... and even look at the scene from an entirely different perspective.
