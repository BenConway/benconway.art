This page is a just a miscellaneous collection of resources that I've found useful over the years.

# <p style="text-align:center">Free software:</p>


## [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)

A high-quality vector graphics program---makes a good, free replacement for Adobe Illustrator.


## [Blender](https://blender.org)

This is probably my favorite piece of software---a highly versatile 3D modeling program. The learning curve is steep, but it's worth it.


## [MuseScore](https://musescore.org)

MuseScore is a simple and straightforward program for creating music scores.


## [FreeCAD](https://freecad.org)

3D computer-assisted design program. Choose this if you're designing something that you're going to physically build, choose Blender for most other 3D modeling.


## [FreeCAD tutorials](https://wiki.freecad.org/Tutorials)

A good collection of tutorials for using FreeCAD.


## [Gear Generator](https://geargenerator.com)

Free online tool for simulating gear trains.

## [Archaeology, Anthropology, and Interstellar Communication](https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/archaeology_anthropology_and_interstellar_communication.html)

This is a NASA ebook that I've found useful for science fiction writing---it goes into great detail about possible ways that intelligent life on other planets might be different from life on Earth, and realistic challenges that might be encountered communicating with another civilization. If you want to write a story featuring plausible aliens, start here.

## [The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis](https://www.cia.gov/static/9a5f1162fd0932c29bfed1c030edf4ae/Pyschology-of-Intelligence-Analysis.pdf)

I've referred to this one for a few scientific illustration projects---it was originally intended as a training textbook for CIA analysts, but it works pretty well as a general introduction to various concepts in psychology.
