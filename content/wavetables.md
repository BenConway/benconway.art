Making music from leaves!
I've been thinking about this concept for a while. Recently an Andrew Huang video inspired me to try it. The idea is to draw a shape onto special graph paper and then use Csound to digitally convert it into a sound waveform. This is a waveform based on a leaf, which I used in several pieces on my latest album, Physics for Squirrels.

Here's an example, using the waveform above and a 1000Hz low-pass filter to smooth out the sound:
<div style="margin: 0 auto; display: table;">
	<audio controls class = "centered" src="/200-filtered.wav" align="center"></audio>
</div>
	<br/>
