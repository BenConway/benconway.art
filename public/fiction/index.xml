      <description>The Story The truck drove through the gate, and parked in a gravel parking lot between two windowless gray buildings. It was immediately surrounded by security guards. The driver got out and showed them her identification paperwork.&#xA;Back in the cargo compartment, where no one could see them, the passenger put on a special pair of boots and a vest covered with lenses and mirrors and complicated equipment. They flipped a switch&amp;mdash;and vanished.</description>

      <description>Rahas stood in the makeshift laboratory, looking at the patterns on the oscilloscope screen.&#xA;Something&amp;rsquo;s not right&amp;hellip;&#xA;Something&amp;rsquo;s still wrong&amp;hellip;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m still not working properly&amp;hellip;&#xA;They looked down at the switchboard on their chest. It was supposed to integrate the signals from the different parts of their mind, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. At least, not correctly.&#xA;They looked over at the grimy sheet of graph paper, and at the official wiring diagram next to it.</description>

      <description>Sarah and Nathan had decided to build a child.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve cleared off the table,&amp;rdquo; Nathan said.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;OK, great.&amp;rdquo; Sarah set the down the big cardboard box, and they both started taking the brightly-colored plastic pieces out of it.&#xA;At the bottom of the box, there was a tool kit and an instruction booklet&amp;mdash;fifty pages of semi-comprehensible cave drawings. Sarah looked at the first few pages, and started snapping together the main frame.</description>

      <description>It was a quiet Saturday evening. Roger was sitting in the armchair doing a Sudoku puzzle, and Deer was laying on the floor reading.&#xA;There was a gentle buzz from the servos in one of Deer&amp;rsquo;s arms as he turned the page. He hadn&amp;rsquo;t used to read all that much&amp;mdash;his old robotic arm didn&amp;rsquo;t have the dexterity to turn pages or operate an e-reader, so Roger had included &amp;lsquo;ability to turn pages&amp;rsquo; in the design specs for the new ones.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a small pond in the center of the woods, with traces of a stone foundation nearby. A frog sits on a fallen tree. A few birds fly past.&#xA;No humans have been here for a hundred years. The closest town is Rutherford Junction, sixty miles away at the edge of the wilderness. It&amp;rsquo;s not much of a town&amp;mdash;ten houses, a general store, one paved road, a tiny park, and a very small library.</description>

      <description>Desert Gardens (Expanded) by Ben Conway The Complex was near the center of the desert. The old concrete buildings were crumbling from decades of sand and harsh sun. Some of them were inhabited&amp;mdash;it was hard to tell which ones.&#xA;Sam looked out the window. A piece of trash blew past, and he saw one person walking down the street a few blocks away. That was it.&#xA;I wonder how many people still live here.</description>

      <description>Unicorn Spacecraft by Ben Conway Sunlight is powerful. Whenever light shines on something, it creates pressure.&#xA;And you can use that pressure to move a spacecraft.&#xA;The process of making a spacecraft begins with the unicorns. You can make a solar sail out of anything lightweight and reflective enough, but unicorn hair is the best material. We have six unicorns at our ranch&amp;mdash;Viduria, Sabelia, Sarustia, Aenarian, Salorsia, and Vidosion. There are a few different types of unicorn hair, graded by its coarseness&amp;mdash;different types are useful for different things.</description>

      <description>Desert Gardens by Ben Conway The desert was a barren expanse of sun-baked ground. About every fifteen miles there was a cluster of crumbling houses. It was hard to tell the abandoned houses from the inhabited ones. Near the middle of the desert there was a tiny pond. A few plants grew around it. Those were the only green things for miles.&#xA;An aircraft flew in over the mountains, circled the pond once, and landed.</description>

      <description>Roger was abruptly awakened by Deer&amp;rsquo;s loud electronic dance music, followed by the sound of his hooves as he walked out into the kitchen. Roger reached toward the nightstand to grab his earplugs, accidentally knocking his alarm clock to the floor and setting it off.&#xA;Great start to the day.&#xA;He got up.&#xA;Deer opened the refrigerator with his robotic arm and began packing his lunch&amp;mdash;six jars of peanut butter, which he loaded into his saddlebags.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re orbiting Kapteyn b. I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the photos coming in from the Chiron&amp;rsquo;s cameras and the orbiters we&amp;rsquo;ve released. Kapteyn b is a world of contrasts. The side facing Kapteyn&amp;rsquo;s Star is a sun-baked volcanic desert. The other side is a dark, frozen wasteland. In the middle, there&amp;rsquo;s a place where life can just barely survive.&#xA;The other day I was having lunch in the cafeteria. I looked at the map and saw that the Chiron was flying over the desert&amp;mdash;six hundred kilometers below us was an environment that would make Earth&amp;rsquo;s deserts look like a walk in the park.</description>

      <description>The sun rose over the mountain, illuminating the light fog that filled the valley.&#xA;Ramet and Seja walked along the path that led up the hill, whistling together. They were pulling a small wagon filled with vegetables&amp;mdash;the way they&amp;rsquo;d been doing, five days a week, for the past six years.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s the monument,&amp;rdquo; Seja said. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re halfway to Town.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;It looks different,&amp;rdquo; said Ramet.&#xA;Seja looked at it for a long moment.</description>
