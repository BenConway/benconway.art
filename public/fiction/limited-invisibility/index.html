The Story
</p>
<p>The truck drove through the gate, and parked in a gravel parking lot between two windowless gray buildings. It was immediately surrounded by security guards. The driver got out and showed them her identification paperwork.</p>
<p>Back in the cargo compartment, where no one could see them, the passenger put on a special pair of boots and a vest covered with lenses and mirrors and complicated equipment. They flipped a switch&mdash;and vanished.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>If you looked from the correct angle, you could see their outline faintly. You could still hear them. Certain motion detectors could sense their presence. But as far as human eyes and most cameras were concerned, they were basically invisible.</p>
<p>They checked to make sure their equipment was aligned correctly&mdash;if the vest or boots weren&rsquo;t on quite right, it could end up leaving part of their legs visible.</p>
<p><em>I think we&rsquo;re good.</em> They gave the driver the secret signal.</p>
<p>The driver opened the cargo door and began unloading boxes. Two guards watched her every move, while another one tested each box with chemical swabs and yet another one carried the boxes off to be X-rayed.</p>
<p>Positioning themself carefully so that they couldn&rsquo;t be seen, the passenger climbed out the back of the truck.</p>
<p><em>This is going to be a bit tight&hellip;</em> One of the security guards was standing close to the driver, and sneaking out between them would be a challenge. The passenger was invisible but still throughly tangible&mdash;and they couldn&rsquo;t approach anything or anybody too closely. Anything that came inside their invisibility zone would become invisible to everyone else, and they&rsquo;d become visible to it.</p>
<p>The driver picked up a box. It started to slip out of her hands&mdash;she fumbled for a moment and caught it. The guard backed away slightly, which gave the passenger an extra foot of space.</p>
<p>The passenger threaded their way between the two slowly and carefully.</p>
<p><em>All right. One obstacle down, way too many to go.</em></p>
<hr>
<br/>
<p>They made their way through the hallways of the facility, periodically pausing to check the map. It was slow going&mdash;they had to walk carefully to remain invisible. They&rsquo;d been practicing this for two years and still had to think hard about every step.</p>
<p><em>OK. This corner&rsquo;s going to be a tough one&hellip;</em></p>
<p>There were two cameras, and staying invisible to one would require a maneuver that might make them visible to the other.</p>
<p>They positioned themself carefully out of range of the first camera, then mentally practiced the maneuver. <em>Forward three feet, turn sixty degrees left, walk sideways-ish for four feet, resume normal walking.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when they heard footsteps.</p>
<p><em>Have I been spotted?</em></p>
<p>They carefully snuck forward, pirouetted to the left, and made their way down the hall. Then they took shelter in an alcove next to a water cooler.</p>
<p>A security guard walked past and stopped.</p>
<p>He bent down, took a cup from the water cooler, and filled it up.</p>
<p>He drank from it, looking straight at the passenger a couple of times.</p>
<p>Then he tossed the cup towards the recycle bin. It vanished for an instant and bounced off the passenger&rsquo;s leg before reappearing and landing on the floor.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the kind of people who carelessly throw their trash in the general direction of the bin don&rsquo;t tend to pay much attention to whether or not it abruptly disappears and changes course in midair. The guard was already pretty far down the hall, and suspected nothing.</p>
<p>The passenger went up to a door, and waited.</p>
<p>Someone walked past, opened the door, and went inside. The passenger waited in the hall.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the person left. The passenger slid through the closing door, into a storage room. It was filled with extra office chairs&mdash;and security cameras, and motion sensors. This would be tricky. They couldn&rsquo;t move any of the furniture around, or even get too close to it, since that would show up on the cameras.</p>
<p>So they worked their way quietly and cautiously across the room until they reached the door on the other side. It was the longest ten-foot walk they&rsquo;d taken in their life.</p>
<p>Then they took a listening device from their pocket.</p>
<p>They switched on the listening device&rsquo;s invisibility system and peeled off the paper over the adhesive backing. They placed the paper in their pocket. Then they held out the device on the end of an invisible stick, and stuck it to the wall just a few inches below the ceiling. Next to the door, in a good spot to overhear whatever was said in the conference room on the other side. Angled carefully so it wasn&rsquo;t visible to anyone standing in the room. They shook it to make sure it was fully attached&mdash;it was.</p>
<p>They moved to another part of the room and attached another listening device, always being careful to keep their distance from the wall and not drop anything on the floor.</p>
<p>They had just installed the third listening device when two guards came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone in here?&rdquo; one of them called.</p>
<p>They waited. The passenger didn&rsquo;t move or respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one here. Just like on the security camera. I told you I think that ^#&amp;^ motion sensor is acting up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; The first guard pulled some chairs aside and looked underneath them&mdash;rather ironically, that was one of the few places the passenger <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> hide. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood up again, and the two guards walked out of the room.</p>
<p>Neither of them noticed that the door seemed to hesitate behind them for a moment, nor did they notice a brief and ever-so-slight visual distortion of the door&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<hr>
<br/>
<p>The driver returned with another load of boxes and began unloading them, again under the watchful eyes of the guards. Each box was stamped with a codename and some numbers. Theoretically, no one outside the facility knew what any of it meant. In practice, the significance of a few of the codenames was known. And thanks to the listening devices, they would soon know a lot more.</p>
<p><em>If the listening devices got installed&hellip;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, that&rsquo;s all the boxes. I&rsquo;ll need you to sign the manifest,&rdquo; she told the chief guard.</p>
<p>While they were occupied with that, the passenger climbed up into the cargo area.</p>
<p>The driver took the clipboard from the guard, stowed it in the cargo space, and shut the doors.</p>
<p><em>I hope they made it back.</em> That was a problem with invisibility&mdash;it hid you from the people you wanted to hide from, but it also hid you from everyone else.</p>
<p>She drove out of the facility and out into the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; said the passenger, appearing suddenly behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! You made it!&rdquo; The driver pulled over, giving the passenger time to stash their invisibility rig in a secret compartment and climb into the seat.</p>

What's Real
</p>
<p>There have been many attempts to find a way of making people (and things) invisible. Some currently-promising concepts include metamaterials and the Rochester cloak.</p>
<p>Metamaterials are complex, advanced light-manipulating materials. They could potentially make objects invisible, but most metamaterials can only do this with certain colors of light. (There have been some recent discoveries that may change this, however.)</p>
<p>The Rochester cloak is actually very straightforward and easy to build, using only 4 lenses. However, it can only make objects invisible from certain angles. You can read more <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/watch-rochester-cloak-uses-ordinary-lenses-to-hide-objects-across-continuous-range-of-angles-70592/">here.</a></p>
<p>Both of these technologies are mostly effective at hiding objects from detection by light (though metamaterials may be able to hide objects from sound waves as well.) Other detection methods, like watching for disturbances to physical objects (such as footprints), could still detect even a completely invisible object.</p>
<p>The limitations of these technologies got me thinking about the possibilities of a partially-effective invisibility system. Such a system could still have uses&mdash;for one thing, if an object were mostly invisible to the naked eye, people might simply ignore other indications of its presence.</p>
