One powerful technique is called Occam&#39;s Razor: simpler explanations tend to be better than more complicated ones. (For instance, fictitious conspiracy theories tend to involve a lot of events in different places and organizations, whereas real political misconduct tends to be fairly limited in scope.)&lt;br/&gt;Another helpful tool is to look for the right kind of evidence: instead of searching for evidence to confirm a particular idea, it&#39;s usually more helpful to look for evidence that lets you distinguish between different explanations (for instance, trying to find evidence that would disprove the idea you think is correct.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233879&#39; target=blank&gt;An automated pipeline for the discovery of conspiracy and conspiracy theory narrative frameworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.cia.gov/static/9a5f1162fd0932c29bfed1c030edf4ae/Pyschology-of-Intelligence-Analysis.pdf&#39; target=blank&gt;The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

Heuer, Jr.), and How The Ocean Works (by Mark Denny.)&lt;br/&gt;The first book describes an experiment where horse-racing experts were asked to predict the outcome of a race based on varying amounts of information (from 5 pieces of information about each horse, up to 40 pieces of information.) Interestingly, increasing the amount of information available had very little effect on the accuracy of the predictions (though it did falsely increase the experts&#39; confidence in their accuracy.)&lt;br/&gt;In the second book, the author describes a discussion of 3 mathematical models for understanding natural processes in the ocean. One model used 3 pieces of information and produced an 80% accurate result, one produced a 90% accurate result from seven or eight inputs, and one used fifteen pieces of information to produce a 95% accurate result. Dick Barber of Duke University made an interesting argument that the first model was, in some sense, better. While it only achieved 80% accuracy, it did so with very little information---and so the information it did use was clearly very important.&lt;br/&gt;So the next time you&#39;re trying to understand something, ask yourself what information you really need." data-buttontext="">

That international project uses satellites to detect distress calls and send help to people who need it---shipwrecked sailors, lost hikers, etc.&lt;br/&gt;COSPAS/SARSAT operates radio receivers attached to dozens of satellites. When someone has an emergency down here on the ground, they can send a signal up to the satellites, and the message then gets relayed to search-and-rescue personnel. It&#39;s estimated that at least 397 lives were saved by this system in 2022 alone.&lt;br/&gt;I think it&#39;s really cool that people have worked together to build this advanced system to keep people safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://blogs.nasa.gov/goes/2018/02/27/goes-s-prelaunch-briefings-today/&#39; target=blank&gt;GOES-S Prelaunch Briefing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;http://cospas-sarsat.int/en/current-space-segment-status-and-sar-payloads&#39; target=blank&gt;Current Space Segment Status and SAR Payloads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-satellites-helped-save-397-lives-in-2022&#39; target=blank&gt;NOAA Satellites Helped Save 397 Lives in 2022&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

						<a href="" data-largesrc="/img/LOIRP-web.jpg" data-title="Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project" data-description="Doing digital archaeology to rescue classic photos of the Moon!&lt;br/&gt;The story behind this image starts in the 1960s, when NASA launched a series of Lunar Orbiter missions to map the lunar surface. The Lunar Orbiters photographed the Moon on film (!), developed the film in an automated onboard laboratory, scanned the film, and beamed the images back to Earth. The images were recorded on reel-to-reel magnetic tape, and were very useful when the time came to choose the sites for the Apollo landings. Then the tapes were put in storage, and kind of got forgotten about for decades.&lt;br/&gt;Then, around 2008, scientists needed the images again. There were new spacecraft orbiting the Moon, but it was important to know what the Moon had looked like years earlier to see how it had changed over time. But no one had a working drive to read the images off of the tapes.&lt;br/&gt;So a group of people went and found an old tape drive. Then they restored it to working condition (no easy feat), and figured out how to connect it to a modern computer. Then they figured out how to decipher the data format used on the tapes, and eventually managed to recover all of the images.&lt;br/&gt; For more information, see &lt;a href=&#39;https://moonviews.com/&#39;&gt;moonviews.com&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

The sun had just set, so it was getting dark. The streetlights were coming on, and fog was rolling in around the houses. It was such a striking contrast between the natural and artificial worlds that I finally had to make an image of it.&lt;br/&lt;br/&gt;Technical details:&lt;br/&gt;Blender 3.2, Cycles render, 10 minute time limit per tile. The clouds and fog were created by painting a texture in Krita and then using that to control the density of a volume material. The background is a gradient texture composited in with a Z Combine node. The windows of the houses are a Glossy/Emission mixed material, with the emission strength randomized using the Per Island output of a Geometry input node." data-buttontext="">

						<a href="" data-largesrc="/img/IonianEnchantment_boosted-web.jpg" data-title="Ionian Enchantment" data-description="Finding beauty in the laws of physics!&lt;br/&gt;This image is based on a concept that the scientist Edward O. Wilson called the Ionian Enchantment. This is the feeling that you get when you really think about how all the complexity of the universe is created by the same simple physical principles. For example: when light reflects off of a tree, it&#39;s doing exactly what it does when it reflects off of the Moon. Physical forces operate in the same way throughout the whole universe, and we can (approximately) understand them. There will always be uncertainties, complexities, and things we don&#39;t know---the world will always be blurry---but there are a lot of things that we do know, and it&#39;s worth taking a moment to appreciate that once in a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the book Why does E=mc2? (And Why Should We Care?) (Brian Cox &amp; Jeff Forshaw, 2009)" data-buttontext="">

While en route, a massive storm developed, covering the entire Martian surface with thick dust clouds. Fortunately, Mariner 9 was equipped with a computer that could be re-programmed while in flight---so the mission controllers simply changed the program so that it would map the planet later, when the dust had cleared.&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the storm did stop, and Mariner 9 continued its mission---discovering a 3000-kilometer-long canyon system, which was named Valles Marineris in honor of the spacecraft.&lt;br/&gt;So sometimes, you need to change your original plan because of factors you can&#39;t control, and wait a while for conditions to improve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can buy a poster of this image &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.zazzle.com/patience_mariner_9_spacecraft_poster-228062342115238507&#39; target = blank&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-051A&#39; target=blank&gt;Mariner 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_83.html&#39; target = blank&gt;Valles Marineris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further Reading:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-045A&#39; target = blank&gt;Mars 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-049A&#39; target = blank&gt;Mars 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-049F&#39; target = blank&gt;Mars 3 Lander&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;http://mentallandscape.com/C_CatalogMars.htm&#39; target = blank&gt;Soviet Mars Images&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

Also, pectin is inexpensive and environmentally friendly to produce, so it could be used to make more sustainable electronics.

This spacecraft was launched in 1978 as International Sun/Earth Explorer 3, collecting data about Earth&#39;s magnetic field, the Sun, and their interactions with each other. Then, in 1982, NASA repurposed the probe to explore a comet. Using some gravity assists, the probe was sent towards Comet Giacobini-Zinner (and later, Halley&#39;s Comet), collecting data far beyond its designers&#39; original intentions.&lt;br/&gt;But the story doesn&#39;t end there. In 2014, the vehicle&#39;s orbit brought it close to Earth again. An unofficial team was able to re-establish contact with the probe and briefly operate it---36 years after its launch.&lt;br/&gt;So you never know what you and your tools might be capable of. Even an old 1970s-era spacecraft had a lot of untapped potential, and clever thinking enabled people to accomplish a lot with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1978-079A&#39; target=blank&gt;National Space Science Data Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/crowdfunded-project-reboots-36-year-old-isee-3-spacecraft-n118106&#39; target=blank&gt;Crowdfunded Project Reboots 36-Year-Old ISEE-3 Spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;http://spacecollege.org/isee3/&#39; target=blank&gt;Space College: ISEE-3&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

This isn&#39;t useful for weather prediction, but it can be used for other things. By carefully analyzing the radar data, scientists can determine which radar returns come from flocks of migrating birds.&lt;br/&gt;When migrating birds pass through a brightly-lit city at night, it can be dangerous for them---the bright lights confuse the birds and can make them run into buildings. But since scientists can track the birds on radar, they can warn the cities in advance---people in the birds&#39; flight path can then shut off their non-essential lights, allowing the birds to continue on their way safely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://mailchi.mp/cornell/release-migration-is-on-turn-lights-off-1323897?e=f0b505020c&#39;&gt;Migration Is On, Turn Lights Off.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://birdcast.info/&#39;&gt;BirdCast.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://birdcast.info/news/a-primer-for-using-weather-surveillance-radar-to-study-bird-migration/&#39;&gt;A Primer For Using Weather Surveillance Radar To Study Bird Migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.weather.gov/bmx/radar_dualpol&#39;&gt;Dual-Polarization Radar&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

One of the Csound instruments in this song uses &lt;a href=&#39;https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/harcon.html?id=9414750&#39;&gt;NOAA data&lt;/a&gt; to synthesize a similar waveform at audio frequencies---the sound of the interactions between the Moon, the Sun, and the sea.&lt;br/&gt;Morning Run is another experiment in a less-ambient direction---it has more of a melody and structure to it. It was partially inspired by a visit to New England in 2021.&lt;br/&gt;Mountain Snow was an experiment with acoustic instruments and extreme time-stretching using the Paulstretch algorithm. The whooshing sounds in the background are derived from the same recording as the primary melodic motif, just stretched out a lot.&lt;br/&gt;And Observe the Universe is inspired by a philosophical motto that I&#39;ve been trying to live by: &#39;Stop worrying and observe the universe.&#39; (The first half of the motto is much harder. I&#39;ll probably write a piece of music about that some day, too.)" data-buttontext="">

Ranger 1 and 2 (at the bottom of the image) were prototype missions, intended to stay in Earth orbit to test the spacecraft systems. Unfortunately, they both ended up in orbits much too low to accomplish their mission. Ranger 3 (middle, left) was an ambitious mission to study the Moon up close and land a scientific instrument package on the lunar surface, but it missed the Moon entirely. Ranger 4 experienced a computer failure and made an uncontrolled crash landing on the far side of the Moon without returning any data. Ranger 5 missed the Moon again due to electrical problems. Ranger 6 was a much-simplified mission carrying only TV cameras to photograph the Moon up close---it reached the Moon all right, but then the cameras malfunctioned and didn&#39;t turn on. But finally, on July 31, 1964, Ranger 7 performed its mission perfectly---taking 4,316 pictures of the Moon and transmitting them back to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;So even if your previous attempts at something didn&#39;t work out, it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ll never succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information from &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4210/pages/TOC.htm&#39; target=blank&gt;Lunar Impact: A History of Project Ranger.&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

This type of star becomes brighter and fainter according to a regular pattern. In 1912, the astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered that the speed of a Cepheid variable&#39;s pulsation is related to how much light it produces. If you see a Cepheid variable pulsing slowly, but it looks very faint, you can tell that it&#39;s actually a bright star that&#39;s just located far away. (A closer star would have to produce less light to look that faint, and if it produced less light it would blink faster.) Astronomers used this relationship, called Leavitt&#39;s Law, to determine that the Andromeda Galaxy is in fact a galaxy, and not just a cloud in our own galaxy. Leavitt&#39;s Law continues to be used to make accurate measurements of cosmic distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References and further reading:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.aavso.org/vsots_delcep&#39;&gt;Delta Cephei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/cepheids.html&#39;&gt;Cepheids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110701.html&#39;&gt;VAR!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~jerjen/researchprojects/cepheids/cepheids.html&#39;&gt;Cepheid Research Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.aavso.org/cosmic-distance-ladder&#39;&gt;Cosmic Distance Ladder&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

So frequently it got reused---someone would scrape the writing off of an old document and write over it. This type of overwritten document is known as a palimpsest. Many historically-significant documents were lost in this way---but they weren&#39;t quite gone.&lt;br/&gt;Electrons moving at close to the speed of light produce powerful blasts of X-rays under certain conditions. Scientists working with particle accelerators thought this was a nuisance at first, but then they realized that the intense X-rays could actually be useful.&lt;br/&gt;And one use turned out to be retrieving the original, lost text from palimpsests. The X-rays can cause the remnants of the erased ink to fluoresce, thus allowing the missing text to be recovered.

You&#39;re certainly welcome to find your own meaning in these sounds.&lt;br/&gt;Some of the tracks on this album grew out of experiments with Csound&#39;s non-linear filter. This is a software audio processing unit which is only partially documented---the Csound manual gives only a brief explanation of it. I explored the filter&#39;s settings in a partially systematic way, producing some new sounds that are heard (along with many others) on this album.&lt;br/&gt;Emerald Tower was a continuation of my previous experiments in making waveforms based on visual shapes---turns out there are a lot of different uses for the shapes of trees and plants. Who knew?&lt;br/&gt;Existence was an experiment of a different kind---writing a piece primarily for non-software instruments. It&#39;s still processed and assembled with Csound, but most of the sound was produced with physical instruments (lap harp/dulcimer, Hammond organ, child&#39;s accordion.)

The general intent of this music is to explore new approaches to sound creation while also moving the listener to a calmer state of mind. Most of the pieces on this album began as experiments with different aspects of the Csound language, which were then expanded into full tracks. For instance, Skyline began as an experiment with wave-terrain synthesis. Resilience and Rustic began as different ways to process recordings of a children&#39;s accordion. Other tracks on this album (in particular Blue and Winter Garden) were experiments in creating &lt;a href=&#39;/wavetables/&#39;&gt;new waveforms based on the shapes of leaves and trees.&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

It wasn&#39;t just a simple matter of one or two people figuring something out. First, Oswald Avery discovered that genetic information was carried by DNA---this was the foundational discovery that others built on. Then Alexander Todd discovered that the DNA molecule had a repeating structure of sugar and phosphate compounds. Erwin Chargaff discovered that certain components of the DNA molecule occurred at the same proportions relative to each other. Wilkins and Franklin discovered that the molecule was a helix or spiral. Models were proposed to explain the DNA structure but didn&#39;t fit the data, Linus Pauling&#39;s proposed model can be seen lying in the background. Finally, scientist Jerry Donohue suggested an alternate form of the molecules to use in the model, at which point Watson and Crick discovered the now-famous double helix structure.
