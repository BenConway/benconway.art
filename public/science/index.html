						<a href="" data-largesrc="/img/BetterWorld-web.jpg" data-title="Better World" data-description="We can create a better world for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;Lately I&#39;ve been learning a lot about sustainability. Environmental issues are significant, but we can fix them---and still allow everyone to live a good life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#43; Renewable energy is important. Wind turbines and solar panels provide electricity, and can help make the power grid more reliable. Walking and biking are good choices for renewable transportation. Windows and skylights are an efficient way to light buildings during the daytime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#43; Reuse and recycling are also a part of the solution. Current methods of production rely primarily on extracting material, using it once, and then discarding it. The concept of a &#39;circular economy&#39; is based on reusing materials over and over again. Unneeded items can be redistributed to people who need them, damaged items can be repaired, and things that are truly beyond hope can be recycled back into raw materials. This is true for all kinds of things, from laptops to buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#43; Plants can help too. Bamboo is a useful material, and bamboo plants help remove carbon from the atmosphere. Urban green space can contribute to making cities more resilient to climate change. Restoring damaged natural habitats can mitigate a wide range of environmental issues. Alternative agricultural methods can produce food more sustainably.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#43; Rainfall collection can help mitigate climate-related water shortages by storing up water during rainy seasons for use during dry seasons. It also helps alleviate other environmental issues, such as flooding and stormwater pollution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So we can do something. There are problems, but we can fix them. Go to a thrift store instead of buying something new. Walk or bike somewhere instead of driving. Fix something that&#39;s broken. Plant a tree.

Psyche (the asteroid) orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, and has an unusually metal-rich composition. This indicates that it may be an exposed fragment of a larger object&#39;s core---a remnant of the tumultuous early days of our Solar System. We know that much from looking at the asteroid with telescopes and radar---to learn more, we&#39;ll have to get a closer look. So Psyche (the vehicle) has now begun its several-year voyage to the asteroid, to get that closer look. For more information, go to the Psyche mission websites (&lt;a href=&#39;https://psyche.asu.edu&#39; target=blank&gt;psyche.asu.edu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#39;https://blogs.nasa.gov/psyche/&#39; target=blank&gt;blogs.nasa.gov/psyche&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;(Footnote: I actually had a couple of internships doing illustrations for the Psyche mission, back in 2018 and 2019.)" data-buttontext="">

The liquid metal flows and generates a magnetic field that shields the planet against hazardous radiation from space.&lt;br/&gt;Up here at the surface, there are layers of silicate-based rocks---a lot of different kinds, each the product of processes that take place over millions of years. (And they&#39;re not done---rock formations are constantly eroding, with their materials being carried off and eventually reprocessed into other rocks.)&lt;br/&gt;Then there&#39;s the ocean, which covers about 70% of the Earth&#39;s surface. Only 5% of its volume has really been explored---there&#39;s a lot still to discover out there.&lt;br/&gt;And all throughout the world, there&#39;s life---plants, animals, you, me, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Surrounding us, there&#39;s the atmosphere, which is filled with amazing transient formations like clouds and weather fronts. At every moment in time, it&#39;s a little bit different.&lt;br/&gt;And then, outside of the atmosphere, there&#39;s a whole universe of stars and planets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://sos.noaa.gov/catalog/datasets/land-to-sea-ratio/&#39; target = blank&gt;NOAA: Land to Sea Ratio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/magnetometer/magnetometer.html&#39; target=blank&gt;NOAA: Magnetometer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://oceanliteracy.unesco.org/ocean-exploration/&#39; target=blank&gt;UNESCO: Ocean Exploration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/core/&#39; target=blank&gt;National Geographic: Earth&#39;s Core&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

One powerful technique is called Occam&#39;s Razor: simpler explanations tend to be better than more complicated ones. (For instance, fictitious conspiracy theories tend to involve a lot of events in different places and organizations, whereas real political misconduct tends to be fairly limited in scope.)&lt;br/&gt;Another helpful tool is to look for the right kind of evidence: instead of searching for evidence to confirm a particular idea, it&#39;s usually more helpful to look for evidence that lets you distinguish between different explanations (for instance, trying to find evidence that would disprove the idea you think is correct.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233879&#39; target=blank&gt;An automated pipeline for the discovery of conspiracy and conspiracy theory narrative frameworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.cia.gov/static/9a5f1162fd0932c29bfed1c030edf4ae/Pyschology-of-Intelligence-Analysis.pdf&#39; target=blank&gt;The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

Heuer, Jr.), and How The Ocean Works (by Mark Denny.)&lt;br/&gt;The first book describes an experiment where horse-racing experts were asked to predict the outcome of a race based on varying amounts of information (from 5 pieces of information about each horse, up to 40 pieces of information.) Interestingly, increasing the amount of information available had very little effect on the accuracy of the predictions (though it did falsely increase the experts&#39; confidence in their accuracy.)&lt;br/&gt;In the second book, the author describes a discussion of 3 mathematical models for understanding natural processes in the ocean. One model used 3 pieces of information and produced an 80% accurate result, one produced a 90% accurate result from seven or eight inputs, and one used fifteen pieces of information to produce a 95% accurate result. Dick Barber of Duke University made an interesting argument that the first model was, in some sense, better. While it only achieved 80% accuracy, it did so with very little information---and so the information it did use was clearly very important.&lt;br/&gt;So the next time you&#39;re trying to understand something, ask yourself what information you really need." data-buttontext="">

When someone has an emergency down here on the ground, they can send a signal up to the satellites, and the message then gets relayed to search-and-rescue personnel.

						<a href="" data-largesrc="/img/LOIRP-web.jpg" data-title="Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project" data-description="Doing digital archaeology to rescue classic photos of the Moon!&lt;br/&gt;The story behind this image starts in the 1960s, when NASA launched a series of Lunar Orbiter missions to map the lunar surface. The Lunar Orbiters photographed the Moon on film (!), developed the film in an automated onboard laboratory, scanned the film, and beamed the images back to Earth. The images were recorded on reel-to-reel magnetic tape, and were very useful when the time came to choose the sites for the Apollo landings. Then the tapes were put in storage, and kind of got forgotten about for decades.&lt;br/&gt;Then, around 2008, scientists needed the images again. There were new spacecraft orbiting the Moon, but it was important to know what the Moon had looked like years earlier to see how it had changed over time. But no one had a working drive to read the images off of the tapes.&lt;br/&gt;So a group of people went and found an old tape drive. Then they restored it to working condition (no easy feat), and figured out how to connect it to a modern computer. Then they figured out how to decipher the data format used on the tapes, and eventually managed to recover all of the images.&lt;br/&gt; For more information, see &lt;a href=&#39;https://moonviews.com/&#39;&gt;moonviews.com&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

Wilson  called the Ionian Enchantment. This is the feeling that you get when you really think about how all the complexity of the universe is created by the same simple physical principles. For example: when light reflects off of a tree, it&#39;s doing exactly what it does when it reflects off of the Moon. Physical forces operate in the same way throughout the whole universe, and we can (approximately) understand them. There will always be uncertainties, complexities, and things we don&#39;t know---the world will always be blurry---but there are a lot of things that we do know, and it&#39;s worth taking a moment to appreciate that once in a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by the book Why does E=mc2?

While en route, a massive storm developed, covering the entire Martian surface with thick dust clouds. Fortunately, Mariner 9 was equipped with a computer that could be re-programmed while in flight---so the mission controllers simply changed the program so that it would map the planet later, when the dust had cleared.&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, the storm did stop, and Mariner 9 continued its mission---discovering a 3000-kilometer-long canyon system, which was named Valles Marineris in honor of the spacecraft.&lt;br/&gt;So sometimes, you need to change your original plan because of factors you can&#39;t control, and wait a while for conditions to improve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can buy a poster of this image &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.zazzle.com/patience_mariner_9_spacecraft_poster-228062342115238507&#39; target = blank&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-051A&#39; target=blank&gt;Mariner 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_83.html&#39; target = blank&gt;Valles Marineris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further Reading:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-045A&#39; target = blank&gt;Mars 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-049A&#39; target = blank&gt;Mars 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-049F&#39; target = blank&gt;Mars 3 Lander&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;http://mentallandscape.com/C_CatalogMars.htm&#39; target = blank&gt;Soviet Mars Images&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

Then, in 1982, NASA repurposed the probe to explore a comet. Using some gravity assists, the probe was sent towards Comet Giacobini-Zinner (and later, Halley&#39;s Comet), collecting data far beyond its designers&#39; original intentions.&lt;br/&gt;But the story doesn&#39;t end there. In 2014, the vehicle&#39;s orbit brought it close to Earth again.

Ranger 1 and 2 (at the bottom of the image) were prototype missions, intended to stay in Earth orbit to test the spacecraft systems. Unfortunately, they both ended up in orbits much too low to accomplish their mission. Ranger 3 (middle, left) was an ambitious mission to study the Moon up close and land a scientific instrument package on the lunar surface, but it missed the Moon entirely. Ranger 4 experienced a computer failure and made an uncontrolled crash landing on the far side of the Moon without returning any data. Ranger 5 missed the Moon again due to electrical problems. Ranger 6 was a much-simplified mission carrying only TV cameras to photograph the Moon up close---it reached the Moon all right, but then the cameras malfunctioned and didn&#39;t turn on. But finally, on July 31, 1964, Ranger 7 performed its mission perfectly---taking 4,316 pictures of the Moon and transmitting them back to Earth.&lt;br/&gt;So even if your previous attempts at something didn&#39;t work out, it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;ll never succeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information from &lt;a href=&#39;https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4210/pages/TOC.htm&#39; target=blank&gt;Lunar Impact: A History of Project Ranger.&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

This type of star becomes brighter and fainter according to a regular pattern. In 1912, the astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered that the speed of a Cepheid variable&#39;s pulsation is related to how much light it produces. If you see a Cepheid variable pulsing slowly, but it looks very faint, you can tell that it&#39;s actually a bright star that&#39;s just located far away. (A closer star would have to produce less light to look that faint, and if it produced less light it would blink faster.) Astronomers used this relationship, called Leavitt&#39;s Law, to determine that the Andromeda Galaxy is in fact a galaxy, and not just a cloud in our own galaxy. Leavitt&#39;s Law continues to be used to make accurate measurements of cosmic distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;References and further reading:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.aavso.org/vsots_delcep&#39;&gt;Delta Cephei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/cepheids.html&#39;&gt;Cepheids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110701.html&#39;&gt;VAR!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~jerjen/researchprojects/cepheids/cepheids.html&#39;&gt;Cepheid Research Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.aavso.org/cosmic-distance-ladder&#39;&gt;Cosmic Distance Ladder&lt;/a&gt;" data-buttontext="">

It&#39;s based on the techniques used to make stone tools. In the oldest archaeological sites, there&#39;s significant variation in the tools (and, by inference, the techniques used to make them.) But at some point, the tools and techniques become more similar. It&#39;s likely that this increased similarity was caused by the toolmakers being able to learn how to do things from each other.

Many historically-significant documents were lost in this way---but they weren&#39;t quite gone.&lt;br/&gt;Electrons moving at close to the speed of light produce powerful blasts of X-rays under certain conditions. Scientists working with particle accelerators thought this was a nuisance at first, but then they realized that the intense X-rays could actually be useful.&lt;br/&gt;And one use turned out to be retrieving the original, lost text from palimpsests. The X-rays can cause the remnants of the erased ink to fluoresce, thus allowing the missing text to be recovered.

The concept of a Europa mission has been around for decades, and it&#39;s taken this long for the plan to be revised, cancelled, revised, cancelled, revised, and finally approved through some impressive political maneuvering.

It wasn&#39;t just a simple matter of one or two people figuring something out. First, Oswald Avery discovered that genetic information was carried by DNA---this was the foundational discovery that others built on. Then Alexander Todd discovered that the DNA molecule had a repeating structure of sugar and phosphate compounds. Erwin Chargaff discovered that certain components of the DNA molecule occurred at the same proportions relative to each other. Wilkins and Franklin discovered that the molecule was a helix or spiral. Models were proposed to explain the DNA structure but didn&#39;t fit the data, Linus Pauling&#39;s proposed model can be seen lying in the background. Finally, scientist Jerry Donohue suggested an alternate form of the molecules to use in the model, at which point Watson and Crick discovered the now-famous double helix structure.
