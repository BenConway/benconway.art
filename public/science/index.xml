      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with data visualization using Python and Matplotlib. I also recently read Rachel Carson&amp;rsquo;s classic book, The Sea Around Us, which inspired me to try visualizing the tides. This page is a collection of some of my experiments. I&amp;rsquo;ll update this page whenever I finish a new visualization. Data from https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov unless otherwise noted.&#xA;This is a very basic visualization&amp;mdash;just the water levels in Alameda, CA during November of 2021.</description>

      <description>There is strong evidence that various psychological exercises can have a powerful effect on reducing prejudice. This article summarizes my understanding of some scientific papers I&amp;rsquo;ve read about the concept of prejudice reduction.&#xA;A good introduction to the concept can be found in this article.&#xA;These articles have been peer-reviewed, but science is a process of change and improvement&amp;mdash;the understanding of this subject may change with future research. A certain amount of psychological research has been performed in search of a one-shot intervention that reduces bias for extended periods of time (&amp;ldquo;bias vaccine.</description>

      <title>DNA Structure</title>

      <description>This is an illustration about the discovery of the structure of DNA, and all of the evidence that had to be built up to make that discovery. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a simple matter of one or two people figuring something out. First, Oswald Avery discovered that genetic information was carried by DNA&amp;mdash;this was the foundational discovery that others built on. Then Alexander Todd discovered that the DNA molecule had a repeating structure of sugar and phosphate compounds.</description>

      <title>Natural Cycles</title>

      <description>This is an illustration of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s nitrogen, water, and carbon cycles. These natural processes are important to the entire ecosystem. Most images only show one of these cycles, so I decided to create an image that showed all three together. Reservoirs (places where material accumulates) are indicated with letters, processes that exchange material between reservoirs are indicated with numbers.&#xA;Nitrogen: A: Atmosphere.&#xA;1: Nitrogen fixation by bacteria.&#xA;2: Nitrogen fixation by lightning.</description>
