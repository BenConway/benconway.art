      <description>The sun rose over the mountain, illuminating the light fog that filled the valley.
Ramet and Seja walked along the path that led up the hill, whistling together. They were pulling a small wagon filled with vegetables&amp;mdash;the way they&amp;rsquo;d been doing, five days a week, for the past six years.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an illustrator specializing in scientific and technical illustration.
My objective with my artwork is to create a sense of wonder and to convey knowledge. I want to explain science and show people how interesting and exciting the world really is.
Some of my images are created entirely from imagination to convey a new world. Other images are created to exact technical specifications, to produce an accurate rendition of a real spacecraft or object.</description>
