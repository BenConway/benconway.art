description = "Invisibility devices have long been a part of science fiction and fantasy. Technology is beginning to catch up---though existing invisibility systems are still rather limited. But a limited invisibility system might still be useful, even if using it could be a bit hair-raising. That's the premise of my latest science fiction story, Limited Invisibility, which you can read <a href='/fiction/limited-invisibility/'>here.</a>"

It's a longer version of a project I released a few months ago. I expanded the story to give more details, made new illustrations, and wrote a few more pieces of music for it. There's also a What's Real section so you can learn about the real-world equivalents of the things in the story."

alt = "Unicorn Spacecraft"
description = "<a href='/fiction/unicorn-spacecraft'>Hard science fiction story</a> with unicorns in it. It's fairly grounded in actual science. The story focuses on the construction of solar sails---these are real and several have been launched. It also involves space elevators---these could exist in the future, if we can figure out how to make strong enough materials. Most science fiction writers just hand-wave through the 'making strong enough materials' part, so I figured I'd use unicorn hair in this story since unicorns are cool."

description = "This piece is based on the effects that the urban environment has on animals. It's set in a fictional world not much different from our own, in which the animals start to become more intelligent due to the effects of the city. Signs of intelligence include tool use, collaboration, use of public transit, and literacy (shown here by a squirrel reading a newspaper over someone's shoulder.)</br></br>\"The animals are adapting to the city environment. They're making tools from trash and learning to communicate. Despite toxic chemicals and other hazards, they're thriving. At the edges, in the forgotten and worn-down patches of green space, a new civilization is emerging.\""

This is my first significant foray in that direction, I intend to do more projects like this."
