description = "This is a piece from a series representing the fictional expedition of the Interstellar Exploration Vehicle Chiron. This is a hard science fiction story that I'm creating. The story follows an expedition to the exoplanet Kapteyn b, and the alien plants that the expedition discovers there.

description = "This piece is based on the effects that the urban environment has on animals. It's set in a fictional world not much different from our own, in which the animals start to become more intelligent due to the effects of the city. Signs of intelligence include tool use, collaboration, use of public transit, and literacy (shown here by a squirrel reading a newspaper over someone's shoulder.)</br></br>\"The animals are adapting to the city environment. They're making tools from trash and learning to communicate. Despite toxic chemicals and other hazards, they're thriving. At the edges, in the forgotten and worn-down patches of green space, a new civilization is emerging.\""

The music was created using the Csound audio programming environment. I've been interested in the possibility of combining visual art, music, and writing for a long time. This is my first significant foray in that direction, I intend to do more projects like this."
