alt = "Chess for Dogs Album Cover"
description = "This is the cover for my first album of ambient music, Chess for Dogs, which can be purchased on <a href='https://benconway.bandcamp.com/album/chess-for-dogs'>Bandcamp.</a> The objects in the cabinet reflect my musical process and the things that inspire me: travel and nature. The pieces of paper pinned to the back wall of the cabinet include snippets of Csound code. (Csound is the audio programming environment that I create most of my music with.) The chess piece, musical note, and metronome represent the fact that I create music by arranging sounds in a carefully planned fashion as opposed to improvising. The Erlenmeyer flask represents the process of experimenting with new sounds. The vehicle in the top center is the pop-top camper van that my family traveled in when I was growing up."

alt = "Peripheral Vision"
description = "This piece is based on the effects that the urban environment has on animals. It's set in a fictional world not much different from our own, in which the animals start to become more intelligent due to the effects of the city. Signs of intelligence include tool use, collaboration, use of public transit, and literacy (shown here by a squirrel reading a newspaper over someone's shoulder.)</br></br>\"The animals are adapting to the city environment. They're making tools from trash and learning to communicate. Despite toxic chemicals and other hazards, they're thriving. At the edges, in the forgotten and worn-down patches of green space, a new civilization is emerging.\""

alt = "Robot Animal"
description = "This is a development of a CCA surface design project. It's a fabric pattern for making a pillow, showing two animals and their whimsical robotic counterparts.

You can see the pillows I made <a href='making/pillows/'>here.</a> The fabric for making the pillows is available <a href='https://www.spoonflower.com/designs/9738353-robot-animal-diy-pillow-by-benconwayart'> on Spoonflower,</a> if you order it make sure you choose Lightweight Cotton Twill as the fabric type so it will be the right size."
