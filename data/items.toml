This isn't useful for weather prediction, but it can be used for other things. By carefully analyzing the radar data, scientists can determine which radar returns come from flocks of migrating birds.<br/>When migrating birds pass through a brightly-lit city at night, it can be dangerous for them---the bright lights confuse the birds and can make them run into buildings. But since scientists can track the birds on radar, they can warn the cities in advance---people in the birds' flight path can then shut off their non-essential lights, allowing the birds to continue on their way safely.<br/><br/> References:<br/><a href='https://mailchi.mp/cornell/release-migration-is-on-turn-lights-off-1323897?e=f0b505020c'>Migration Is On, Turn Lights Off.</a><br/><a href='https://birdcast.info/'>BirdCast.info</a><br/><a href='https://birdcast.info/news/a-primer-for-using-weather-surveillance-radar-to-study-bird-migration/'>A Primer For Using Weather Surveillance Radar To Study Bird Migration</a><br/><a href='https://www.weather.gov/bmx/radar_dualpol'>Dual-Polarization Radar</a>"

One of the Csound instruments in this song uses <a href='https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/harcon.html?id=9414750'>NOAA data</a> to synthesize a similar waveform at audio frequencies---the sound of the interactions between the Moon, the Sun, and the sea.<br/>Morning Run is another experiment in a less-ambient direction---it has more of a melody and structure to it. It was partially inspired by a visit to New England in 2021.<br/>Mountain Snow was an experiment with acoustic instruments and extreme time-stretching using the Paulstretch algorithm. The whooshing sounds in the background are derived from the same recording as the primary melodic motif, just stretched out a lot.<br/>And Observe the Universe is inspired by a philosophical motto that I've been trying to live by: 'Stop worrying and observe the universe.'

Unfortunately, they both ended up in orbits much too low to accomplish their mission. Ranger 3 (middle, left) was an ambitious mission to study the Moon up close and land a scientific instrument package on the lunar surface, but it missed the Moon entirely. Ranger 4 experienced a computer failure and made an uncontrolled crash landing on the far side of the Moon without returning any data. Ranger 5 missed the Moon again due to electrical problems. Ranger 6 was a much-simplified mission carrying only TV cameras to photograph the Moon up close---it reached the Moon all right, but then the cameras malfunctioned and didn't turn on. But finally, on July 31, 1964, Ranger 7 performed its mission perfectly---taking 4,316 pictures of the Moon and transmitting them back to Earth.<br/>So even if your previous attempts at something didn't work out, it doesn't mean that you'll never succeed.<br/><br/>Information from <a href='https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4210/pages/TOC.htm' target=blank>Lunar Impact: A History of Project Ranger.</a>"

In 1912, the astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered that the speed of a Cepheid variable's pulsation is related to how much light it produces. If you see a Cepheid variable pulsing slowly, but it looks very faint, you can tell that it's actually a bright star that's just located far away. (A closer star would have to produce less light to look that faint, and if it produced less light it would blink faster.) Astronomers used this relationship, called Leavitt's Law, to determine that the Andromeda Galaxy is in fact a galaxy, and not just a cloud in our own galaxy. Leavitt's Law continues to be used to make accurate measurements of cosmic distances.<br/><br/>References and further reading:<br/><a href='https://www.aavso.org/vsots_delcep'>Delta Cephei</a><br/><a href='https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/cepheids.html'>Cepheids</a><br/><a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110701.html'>VAR!</a><br/><a href='https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~jerjen/researchprojects/cepheids/cepheids.html'>Cepheid Research Project</a><br/><a href='http://www.aavso.org/cosmic-distance-ladder'>Cosmic Distance Ladder</a>"

It's based on the techniques used to make stone tools. In the oldest archaeological sites, there's significant variation in the tools (and, by inference, the techniques used to make them.) But at some point, the tools and techniques become more similar. It's likely that this increased similarity was caused by the toolmakers being able to learn how to do things from each other.

Many historically-significant documents were lost in this way---but they weren't quite gone.<br/>Electrons moving at close to the speed of light produce powerful blasts of X-rays under certain conditions. Scientists working with particle accelerators thought this was a nuisance at first, but then they realized that the intense X-rays could actually be useful.<br/>And one use turned out to be retrieving the original, lost text from palimpsests. The X-rays can cause the remnants of the erased ink to fluoresce, thus allowing the missing text to be recovered.

You're certainly welcome to find your own meaning in these sounds.<br/>Some of the tracks on this album grew out of experiments with Csound's non-linear filter. This is a software audio processing unit which is only partially documented---the Csound manual gives only a brief explanation of it. I explored the filter's settings in a partially systematic way, producing some new sounds that are heard (along with many others) on this album.<br/>Emerald Tower was a continuation of my previous experiments in making waveforms based on visual shapes---turns out there are a lot of different uses for the shapes of trees and plants. Who knew?<br/>Existence was an experiment of a different kind---writing a piece primarily for non-software instruments. It's still processed and assembled with Csound, but most of the sound was produced with physical instruments (lap harp/dulcimer, Hammond organ, child's accordion.) I plan to use this method more in the future.<br/>So now this batch of experiments is complete, and it's time to move on to the next one. I hope you enjoy the results of my auditory wanderings."

They range from rhythmic tension music (Mechanical Mountain) to music that's contemplative but unstable (Sands of Time.) I've been working on these songs concurrently with my other type of music---Mechanical Mountain was actually written before most of the music on my first album, Chess for Dogs. My music process is very experimental---I don't usually start with a specific idea I'm working toward, just a general concept of the music's feel and instrumentation. Every once in a while the music project I'm working on will develop in this direction. I finally got enough pieces like this to release them together, and I'm planning to keep making more. Enjoy!"

For instance, Skyline began as an experiment with wave-terrain synthesis. Resilience and Rustic began as different ways to process recordings of a children's accordion. Other tracks on this album (in particular Blue and Winter Garden) were experiments in creating <a href='/wavetables/'>new waveforms based on the shapes of leaves and trees.</a>"

LIGO's detectors are sensitive enough to measure these extremely small changes, and thus observe amazing astronomical events in a completely different way from conventional telescopes.<br/>References:<br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligos-ifo'>LIGO's Interferometer</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20200623'>LIGO Finds Mystery Object In Mass Gap</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-is-ligo'>What is LIGO?</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-is-interferometer'>What is an Interferometer?</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligo-detectors'>LIGO Detectors</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/laser'>LIGO's Laser</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/media_files/binaries/303/original/ligo-educators-guide.pdf?1455165573'>LIGO Educator's Guide (PDF)</a>"

description = "This is an illustration about the discovery of the structure of DNA, and all of the evidence that had to be built up to make that discovery. It wasn't just a simple matter of one or two people figuring something out. First, Oswald Avery discovered that genetic information was carried by DNA---this was the foundational discovery that others built on. Then Alexander Todd discovered that the DNA molecule had a repeating structure of sugar and phosphate compounds. Erwin Chargaff discovered that certain components of the DNA molecule occurred at the same proportions relative to each other. Wilkins and Franklin discovered that the molecule was a helix or spiral. Models were proposed to explain the DNA structure but didn't fit the data, Linus Pauling's proposed model can be seen lying in the background. Finally, scientist Jerry Donohue suggested an alternate form of the molecules to use in the model, at which point Watson and Crick discovered the now-famous double helix structure.

The low-gain antennas can’t send as much data, but they don’t require the spacecraft to be aimed as precisely. <a href='https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/teach/activity/build-a-satellite/'>(Source)</a>"

alt = "Spacejunk Lander"
description = "This is a Spacejunk module that allows your spacecraft to land on things. Landing requires something to support the spacecraft on the ground, like the legs on this propulsion unit. Whether the spacecraft lands or stays in space is part of the spacecraft’s ‘mission profile.’ A lot of effort goes into coming up with a good mission profile that will let us learn interesting things, and the process of getting a particular mission approved is very competitive."

description = "This is a Spacejunk payload module. The payload of a spacecraft is all of the equipment that the spacecraft carries to perform its mission once it reaches its destination. For the gold-foil effects on this and other Spacejunk images, I overlaid a partially-transparent 3D model onto an acrylic painting."

description = "Image of the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, in front of a stylized representation of its mission---crossing the asteroid belt, flying by Jupiter and Saturn, and then exploring the outermost reaches of the Solar System. While modeling the spacecraft, I referred to the NASA publication <a href='https://history.nasa.gov/SP-349/contents.htm'>SP-349</a> and the article <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/2013/pioneer11-40-years.html'>NASA Celebrates Four Decades of Plucky Pioneer 11.</a> I also used data from <a href='https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?satellites'>JPL Solar System Dynamics</a> to ensure accuracy in the placement and size of the planets' moons."

alt = "Escape A"
description = "This is an experimental piece, combining traditional and digital media. For a long time my traditional and digital practices were separate---this piece represents climbing over the wall that separates things and escaping into a world where combinations are possible. The trees in the foreground were painted with acrylics, as was the wall texture. The grass is a particle system with a digitally-painted texture. The ground behind the wall was made using ink wash, and the background trees were drawn with a brush pen."

description = "This image was inspired by Saturn's moon Hyperion, which is suspected to have an elaborate maze of caves below its surface. I referred to various NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day pages (including <a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap180514.html'>this one</a>) to get information on Hyperion's appearance, and then imagined this view of the exploration of moon's interior. The astronauts' space suits and equipment are imagined, but intended to be realistic."

description = "3D rendering of a network of space stations tethered to a near-Earth asteroid. Inspired by the randomly-generated phrase 'Vesta Environs.' In this image, there are several different types of space station---habitat stations, agriculture stations, solar power stations, and docking stations. They're supported by their solar sails, while remaining connected to the asteroid by tethers. Elsewhere on the asteroid itself, mining and manufacturing stations are visible---and in the distance, free-flying science spacecraft can be seen."

alt = "Eclipse"
description = "This piece is inspired by the 2017 total solar eclipse. It represents both the actual mechanics of how eclipses work as well as the feeling which the eclipse inspires---the realization that you are standing on a spherical planet with a giant rock orbiting it, realizing the size of the universe, realizing that you yourself are a part of the universe."

description = "This piece was inspired by early morning fog near Daly City, which I observed one morning from BART on my way to school. The combination of moonlight and city lights provided interesting illumination for the fog, and the dark hills and tree shapes provided an interesting contrast---a good subject for a monochromatic digital painting."
