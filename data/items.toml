description = "Lichen is an entire ecosystem in miniature!<br/>A lichen isn't just an algae and a fungus—there are frequently other organisms in there too. And it can be hard to tell exactly what lifeforms make up a lichen—bacteria are often identified by stages in their lifecycle that just don't happen when they're part of a lichen. So a lichen-covered rock or tree branch is, in some sense, its own little world.

description = "Using glowing, technological whirligig seeds to study ecosystems sustainably!<br/>This is one of the coolest ideas I've seen in a while. It's from the article /A printed luminescent flier inspired by plant seeds for eco-friendly physical sensing/ (Cikalleshi et. al, 2023.) This is one of several attempts to address some issues with scientific study of ecosystems, namely, the fact that the sensors needed to collect the data are often expensive and can have negative effects on the environment if they're left behind at the end of the study.<br/><br/>The authors of the article created an inexpensive 3D-printed device, similar to maple seeds. It's made of plant-based plastic, saturated with a safe chemical compound that glows under infrared light. The properties of the glow are proportional to the material's temperature. By scattering a bunch of them from a drone, you can effectively make a whole network of thermal sensors blanketing the region you want to study. When the study is finished, any sensors that get left behind will biodegrade pretty much harmlessly.<br/><br/>Source: science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi8492<br/><p style = 'color: #8b8b8b'>Callisto</p>"

description = "Lately, I've been teaching myself how to build stuff. This is a project I recently finished: a mechanical device for simulating the motion of the Moon around the Earth. The center pointer represents the Earth's orientation relative to the Sun, and the wheel behind it is geared to turn at the rate that the Moon orbits the Earth. I designed it in <a href='https://freecad.org' target=blank>FreeCAD</a>, and had it laser-cut by <a href='https://www.ponoko.com' target=blank>Ponoko.</a> (This isn't a rendering, I actually built it.)<br/><br/>Some things I learned:<br/>+ The motion of the Moon around the Earth is surprisingly complex. There are all kinds of factors that subtly affect the Moon's position, and if you're trying to determine the Moon's phases you also need to account for the Earth's orbit around the Sun as well. (See <a href='https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/moonorbit.html' target=blank>Eclipses and the Moon's Orbit</a> and <a href='https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/61494/pg61494-images.html#Page_347' target=blank>The Modern Clock</a> for details.)<br/>+ You also can't predict exactly when the Moon will rise or set. When it's close to the horizon its apparent position is affected a lot by the atmosphere, so without knowing the exact characteristics of the air you can't tell precisely where the Moon will appear to be. (Telling where the Moon <i>actually</i> is, however, is easier. The atmosphere only affects where it <i>looks like</i> it is.) (<a href='https://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/RST_defs' target=blank>US Naval Observatory</a>)<br/>+ Building a model of something can help you understand it better. I now have a better sense of how the Moon orbits the Earth, and can make approximate determinations about the Moon's position even without the model.<br/>+ When building a geared mechanism, getting the gears the right distance apart is essential. (I struggled with this a lot initially, until I found the formula for gear center distance in Dustyn Roberts' book <i>Making Things Move.</i>)<br/>+ Wooden gears sometimes warp a bit, so you should leave some space above and below them so they can still turn smoothly if that happens.<br/><br/>Other resources I used:<br/><a href='https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/solareqns.PDF' target=blank>General Solar Position Calculations</a><br/><a href='https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12534' target=blank>What determines when we have an eclipse?</a><br/><a href='https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4324' target=blank>2017 Eclipse and the Moon's Orbit</a><br/><p style = 'color: #8b8b8b'>redevelopment</p>"

I use social media (you're reading this), but I make a point of limiting my social media usage to an amount that works for me. (Your amount will be different.

These only toast the bread on one side, requiring the user to flip the bread manually to get it toasted on both sides.<br/>In the next column, we have the rotary toasters. These still only toast the bread on one side, but they're equipped with mechanisms to help the user flip the toast when the time comes.<br/>Then there are linear toasters---the most common kind. They toast the bread on both sides at once, and the bread moves through the machine in a straight line. The type at the top of this column is probably what most of us think of when someone says 'toaster.' But there are plenty of other kinds of linear toaster---including the Toast-o-lator, which moves the toast gradually from one end of the machine to the other. Another toaster in this column is a 12-volt in-car toaster---so you can make toast while you're on the road.<br/>Then there are toaster ovens. I hadn't really thought about these in much detail---I had just assumed that the type at the bottom of the last column was the only kind. But there are many other designs that people have thought of over the years.<br/><br/>I think it's interesting that there are so many ways of solving the same problem. Sometimes when a particular design becomes dominant, it's because it really is the best solution---but other times, it isn't. Maybe a particular design became widespread because it was cheaper to manufacture, or because it was made by the company with the best marketing team, or because a competing better design looked weird. It's important to consider the fact that there's more than one way to do it.<br/><p style = 'color: #8b8b8b'>hiker</p>"

description = "You need a checklist!<br/>This illustration was inspired by a book I read a while ago: The Checklist Manifesto, by Atul Gawande. This book explores the use of checklists in a variety of fields, including aviation, medicine, and construction. Checklists are powerful tools:<br/>+ They help ensure that really basic stuff doesn't get overlooked. (For instance, ensuring that a concert venue's doors are large enough to accommodate a band's equipment.)<br/>+ They help people function as a team. (Some medical checklists require everyone performing a procedure to introduce themselves to each other before starting. This gets people talking, and makes them more likely to speak up if they notice that something isn't right.)<br/>+ They allow people to learn from previous mistakes and accidents. (Whenever there's a serious aviation incident, it gets investigated. Any necessary updates are then made to the relevant checklists, to help keep the same problem from happening again.)<br/>I've applied the information from this book in my own life by making a lot of checklists for procedures at the library where I work. So if you're dealing with some problem, maybe a checklist will help.<br/><p style = 'color: #8b8b8b'>stile</p>"

description = "We can create a better world for everyone.<br/>Lately I've been learning a lot about sustainability. Environmental issues are significant, but we can fix them---and still allow everyone to live a good life.<br/><br/>+ Renewable energy is important. Wind turbines and solar panels provide electricity, and can help make the power grid more reliable. Walking and biking are good choices for renewable transportation. Windows and skylights are an efficient way to light buildings during the daytime.<br/><br/>+ Reuse and recycling are also a part of the solution. Current methods of production rely primarily on extracting material, using it once, and then discarding it. The concept of a 'circular economy' is based on reusing materials over and over again. Unneeded items can be redistributed to people who need them, damaged items can be repaired, and things that are truly beyond hope can be recycled back into raw materials. This is true for all kinds of things, from laptops to buildings.<br/><br/>+ Plants can help too. Bamboo is a useful material, and bamboo plants help remove carbon from the atmosphere. Urban green space can contribute to making cities more resilient to climate change. Restoring damaged natural habitats can mitigate a wide range of environmental issues. Alternative agricultural methods can produce food more sustainably.<br/><br/>+ Rainfall collection can help mitigate climate-related water shortages by storing up water during rainy seasons for use during dry seasons. It also helps alleviate other environmental issues, such as flooding and stormwater pollution.<br/><br/>So we can do something. There are problems, but we can fix them.

Interestingly, increasing the amount of information available had very little effect on the accuracy of the predictions (though it did falsely increase the experts' confidence in their accuracy.)<br/>In the second book, the author describes a discussion of 3 mathematical models for understanding natural processes in the ocean. One model used 3 pieces of information and produced an 80% accurate result, one produced a 90% accurate result from seven or eight inputs, and one used fifteen pieces of information to produce a 95% accurate result. Dick Barber of Duke University made an interesting argument that the first model was, in some sense, better. While it only achieved 80% accuracy, it did so with very little information---and so the information it did use was clearly very important.<br/>So the next time you're trying to understand something, ask yourself what information you really need.<br/><p style = 'color: #8b8b8b'>vacationers</p>"

Using some gravity assists, the probe was sent towards Comet Giacobini-Zinner (and later, Halley's Comet), collecting data far beyond its designers' original intentions.<br/>But the story doesn't end there. In 2014, the vehicle's orbit brought it close to Earth again. An unofficial team was able to re-establish contact with the probe and briefly operate it---36 years after its launch.<br/>So you never know what you and your tools might be capable of. Even an old 1970s-era spacecraft had a lot of untapped potential, and clever thinking enabled people to accomplish a lot with it.<br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1978-079A' target=blank>National Space Science Data Center</a><br/><a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/crowdfunded-project-reboots-36-year-old-isee-3-spacecraft-n118106' target=blank>Crowdfunded Project Reboots 36-Year-Old ISEE-3 Spacecraft</a><br/><a href='http://spacecollege.org/isee3/' target=blank>Space College: ISEE-3</a>"

It was partially inspired by a visit to New England in 2021.<br/>Mountain Snow was an experiment with acoustic instruments and extreme time-stretching using the Paulstretch algorithm. The whooshing sounds in the background are derived from the same recording as the primary melodic motif, just stretched out a lot.<br/>And Observe the Universe is inspired by a philosophical motto that I've been trying to live by: 'Stop worrying and observe the universe.'

Unfortunately, they both ended up in orbits much too low to accomplish their mission. Ranger 3 (middle, left) was an ambitious mission to study the Moon up close and land a scientific instrument package on the lunar surface, but it missed the Moon entirely. Ranger 4 experienced a computer failure and made an uncontrolled crash landing on the far side of the Moon without returning any data. Ranger 5 missed the Moon again due to electrical problems. Ranger 6 was a much-simplified mission carrying only TV cameras to photograph the Moon up close---it reached the Moon all right, but then the cameras malfunctioned and didn't turn on. But finally, on July 31, 1964, Ranger 7 performed its mission perfectly---taking 4,316 pictures of the Moon and transmitting them back to Earth.<br/>So even if your previous attempts at something didn't work out, it doesn't mean that you'll never succeed.<br/><br/>Information from <a href='https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4210/pages/TOC.htm' target=blank>Lunar Impact: A History of Project Ranger.</a>"

If you see a Cepheid variable pulsing slowly, but it looks very faint, you can tell that it's actually a bright star that's just located far away. (A closer star would have to produce less light to look that faint, and if it produced less light it would blink faster.) Astronomers used this relationship, called Leavitt's Law, to determine that the Andromeda Galaxy is in fact a galaxy, and not just a cloud in our own galaxy. Leavitt's Law continues to be used to make accurate measurements of cosmic distances.<br/><br/>References and further reading:<br/><a href='https://www.aavso.org/vsots_delcep'>Delta Cephei</a><br/><a href='https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/cepheids.html'>Cepheids</a><br/><a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110701.html'>VAR!</a><br/><a href='https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~jerjen/researchprojects/cepheids/cepheids.html'>Cepheid Research Project</a><br/><a href='http://www.aavso.org/cosmic-distance-ladder'>Cosmic Distance Ladder</a>"

It's based on the techniques used to make stone tools. In the oldest archaeological sites, there's significant variation in the tools (and, by inference, the techniques used to make them.) But at some point, the tools and techniques become more similar. It's likely that this increased similarity was caused by the toolmakers being able to learn how to do things from each other. I think it's really cool that someone can look at an ancient stone tool and determine things about the mind of the person who made it.<br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=52804#more-52804' target=blank>Language Log interview with Cory Stade.</a><br/><a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figures?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177063' target=blank>Additional information from this PLoS One article.</a>"

Many historically-significant documents were lost in this way---but they weren't quite gone.<br/>Electrons moving at close to the speed of light produce powerful blasts of X-rays under certain conditions. Scientists working with particle accelerators thought this was a nuisance at first, but then they realized that the intense X-rays could actually be useful.<br/>And one use turned out to be retrieving the original, lost text from palimpsests. The X-rays can cause the remnants of the erased ink to fluoresce, thus allowing the missing text to be recovered.

You're certainly welcome to find your own meaning in these sounds.<br/>Some of the tracks on this album grew out of experiments with Csound's non-linear filter. This is a software audio processing unit which is only partially documented---the Csound manual gives only a brief explanation of it. I explored the filter's settings in a partially systematic way, producing some new sounds that are heard (along with many others) on this album.<br/>Emerald Tower was a continuation of my previous experiments in making waveforms based on visual shapes---turns out there are a lot of different uses for the shapes of trees and plants. Who knew?<br/>Existence was an experiment of a different kind---writing a piece primarily for non-software instruments. It's still processed and assembled with Csound, but most of the sound was produced with physical instruments (lap harp/dulcimer, Hammond organ, child's accordion.)

They range from rhythmic tension music (Mechanical Mountain) to music that's contemplative but unstable (Sands of Time.) I've been working on these songs concurrently with my other type of music---Mechanical Mountain was actually written before most of the music on my first album, Chess for Dogs. My music process is very experimental---I don't usually start with a specific idea I'm working toward, just a general concept of the music's feel and instrumentation. Every once in a while the music project I'm working on will develop in this direction. I finally got enough pieces like this to release them together, and I'm planning to keep making more. Enjoy!"

Other tracks on this album (in particular Blue and Winter Garden) were experiments in creating <a href='/wavetables/'>new waveforms based on the shapes of leaves and trees.</a>"

LIGO's detectors are sensitive enough to measure these extremely small changes, and thus observe amazing astronomical events in a completely different way from conventional telescopes.<br/>References:<br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligos-ifo'>LIGO's Interferometer</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20200623'>LIGO Finds Mystery Object In Mass Gap</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-is-ligo'>What is LIGO?</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-is-interferometer'>What is an Interferometer?</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/ligo-detectors'>LIGO Detectors</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/laser'>LIGO's Laser</a><br/><a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/media_files/binaries/303/original/ligo-educators-guide.pdf?1455165573'>LIGO Educator's Guide (PDF)</a>"
