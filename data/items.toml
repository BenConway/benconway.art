alt = "Asteroid Environs"
description = "3D rendering of a network of space stations tethered to a near-Earth asteroid. Inspired by the randomly-generated phrase 'Vesta Environs.' In this image, there are several different types of space station---habitat stations, agriculture stations, solar power stations, and docking stations. They're supported by their solar sails, while remaining connected to the asteroid by tethers. Elsewhere on the asteroid itself, mining and manufacturing stations are visible---and in the distance, free-flying science spacecraft can be seen."

title = "Eclipse"

thumb = "img/eclipse-painted-thumb.png"
alt = "Eclipse"
description = "This piece is inspired by the 2017 total solar eclipse. It represents both the actual mechanics of how eclipses work as well as the feeling which the eclipse inspires---the realization that you are standing on a spherical planet with a giant rock orbiting it, realizing the size of the universe, realizing that you yourself are a part of the universe."

title = "Fog"
image = "img/fog.png"
thumb = "img/fog-thumb.png"
alt = "Fog"
description = "Digital painting inspired by early morning fog near Daly City, which I observed one morning from BART on my way to school. The combination of moonlight and city lights provided interesting illumination for the fog, and the dark hills and tree shapes provided an interesting contrast---the ideal subject for a monochromatic digital painting."

title = "Abandoned City"
image = "img/abandoned-city.png"
thumb = "img/abandoned-city-thumb.png"
alt = "Abandoned City"
description = "This illustration represents a group of explorers landing in an abandoned ancient city. My interest in science is evident here with the image's themes of exploration and discovery. The overall mood of the image is intended to be mysterious with a slight sense of wonder: Where is this place? What happened here?"

title = "Airplane"
image = "img/airplane3.png"
thumb = "img/airplane3-thumb.png"
alt = "Airplane"
description = "Cutaway view of an imaginary airplane. This gives some idea of my technical illustration style. While the details are imaginary, they were all carefully considered to increase the realism of the design. The engine, the size of the wings, bolts holding elements together, and the shape of the fuselage are all intended to make the image as realistic as possible."

title = "Circles"
image = "img/circles-final.png"
thumb = "img/circles-thumb.png"
alt = "Circles"
description = "Abstract digital painting, working with color and shape as well as digital brushwork to convey a feeling."

title = "Discover the World of Reading"
image = "img/library.png"
thumb = "img/library-thumb.png"
alt = "Library"
description = "Illustration of the concept of reading. Books fly off the shelves, begin glowing, and carry ideas away to other places. On the table, paper and a pencil await the viewer's own story. This is a 3D rendering created in Blender, with trees from Blender's tree generator."

title = "Tower"
image = "img/tower-bw.png"
thumb = "img/tower-thumb.png"
alt = "Tower"
description = "3D image of a tower casting its shadow onto a cloud bank. This was created as a study of lighting and cloud effects, and was inspired by a storm I observed near Mono Lake. The tower was intended to give a type of retro-futuristic appearance, while the blue tint suggests a more contemplative mood for the piece and creates more of a focus on value and shadow."
