alt = "Escape A"
description = "This is an experimental piece, combining traditional and digital media. For a long time my traditional and digital practices were separate---this piece represents climbing over the wall that separates things and escaping into a world where combinations are possible. The trees in the foreground were painted with acrylics, as was the wall texture. The grass is a particle system with a digitally-painted texture. The ground behind the wall was made using ink wash, and the background trees were drawn with a brush pen."
