description = "The Story of Energy.<br/>This story starts inside the Sun, where hydrogen atoms (the oldest atoms in the universe) combine in a powerful fusion reaction to release energy. The energy then spends the next 170,000 years or so (!) making its way to the surface of the Sun. Once it reaches the surface, the light crosses the 93-million-mile void to Earth in about eight minutes. Upon arriving on Earth, some of that energy is captured by plants using chlorophyll and chemically stored as glucose, which then powers much of the planet's biosphere directly or indirectly.<br/>Poster available <a href='https://www.zazzle.com/story_of_energy_poster-228038394904112230' target=blank>here.</a><br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/' target=blank>Sun In Depth</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ocean-worlds/' target=blank>Ocean Worlds</a><br/><a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160125.html' target=blank>Astronomy Picture of the Day</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16667503' target=blank>Chlorophyll</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5793' target=blank>Glucose</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/280' target=blank>Carbon dioxide</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/977' target=blank>Oxygen</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/962' target=blank>Water</a><br/><a href='https://ssec.si.edu/stemvisions-blog/what-photosynthesis' target=blank>What Is Photosynthesis?</a>"
