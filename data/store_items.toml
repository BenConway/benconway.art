description = "We're a part of the universe.<br/>There's a lot of wonder out there in the universe---comets, planets, stars, galaxies. There's also a lot of wonder right here on Earth---plants, animals, mountains, the human condition. And it's all a part of the same thing---we're produced by the same fundamental physical forces. The universe is beautifully big and complex and intricate, and we're a part of it. <br>Poster available <a href='https://www.zazzle.com/earth_looking_out_poster-228154753694117729' target=blank>here.</a>"

description = "The Story of Energy.<br/>This story starts inside the Sun, where hydrogen atoms (the oldest atoms in the universe) combine in a powerful fusion reaction to release energy. The energy then spends the next 170,000 years or so (!) making its way to the surface of the Sun. Once it reaches the surface, the light crosses the 93-million-mile void to Earth in about eight minutes. Upon arriving on Earth, some of that energy is captured by plants using chlorophyll and chemically stored as glucose, which then powers much of the planet's biosphere directly or indirectly.<br/>Poster available <a href='https://www.zazzle.com/story_of_energy_poster-228038394904112230' target=blank>here.</a><br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/' target=blank>Sun In Depth</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ocean-worlds/' target=blank>Ocean Worlds</a><br/><a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160125.html' target=blank>Astronomy Picture of the Day</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16667503' target=blank>Chlorophyll</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5793' target=blank>Glucose</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/280' target=blank>Carbon dioxide</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/977' target=blank>Oxygen</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/962' target=blank>Water</a><br/><a href='https://ssec.si.edu/stemvisions-blog/what-photosynthesis' target=blank>What Is Photosynthesis?</a>"

The pieces of paper pinned to the back wall of the cabinet include snippets of Csound code. (Csound is the audio programming environment that I create most of my music with.) The chess piece, musical note, and metronome represent the fact that I create music by arranging sounds in a carefully planned fashion as opposed to improvising. The Erlenmeyer flask represents the process of experimenting with new sounds. The vehicle in the top center is the pop-top camper van that my family traveled in when I was growing up."
