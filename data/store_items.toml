The pieces of paper pinned to the back wall of the cabinet include snippets of Csound code. (Csound is the audio programming environment that I create most of my music with.) The chess piece, musical note, and metronome represent the fact that I create music by arranging sounds in a carefully planned fashion as opposed to improvising. The Erlenmeyer flask represents the process of experimenting with new sounds. The vehicle in the top center is the pop-top camper van that my family traveled in when I was growing up."
