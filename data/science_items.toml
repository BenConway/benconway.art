This isn't useful for weather prediction, but it can be used for other things. By carefully analyzing the radar data, scientists can determine which radar returns come from flocks of migrating birds.<br/>When migrating birds pass through a brightly-lit city at night, it can be dangerous for them---the bright lights confuse the birds and can make them run into buildings. But since scientists can track the birds on radar, they can warn the cities in advance---people in the birds' flight path can then shut off their non-essential lights, allowing the birds to continue on their way safely.<br/><br/> References:<br/><a href='https://mailchi.mp/cornell/release-migration-is-on-turn-lights-off-1323897?e=f0b505020c'>Migration Is On, Turn Lights Off.</a><br/><a href='https://birdcast.info/'>BirdCast.info</a><br/><a href='https://birdcast.info/news/a-primer-for-using-weather-surveillance-radar-to-study-bird-migration/'>A Primer For Using Weather Surveillance Radar To Study Bird Migration</a><br/><a href='https://www.weather.gov/bmx/radar_dualpol'>Dual-Polarization Radar</a>"

Ranger 1 and 2 (at the bottom of the image) were prototype missions, intended to stay in Earth orbit to test the spacecraft systems. Unfortunately, they both ended up in orbits much too low to accomplish their mission. Ranger 3 (middle, left) was an ambitious mission to study the Moon up close and land a scientific instrument package on the lunar surface, but it missed the Moon entirely. Ranger 4 experienced a computer failure and made an uncontrolled crash landing on the far side of the Moon without returning any data. Ranger 5 missed the Moon again due to electrical problems. Ranger 6 was a much-simplified mission carrying only TV cameras to photograph the Moon up close---it reached the Moon all right, but then the cameras malfunctioned and didn't turn on. But finally, on July 31, 1964, Ranger 7 performed its mission perfectly---taking 4,316 pictures of the Moon and transmitting them back to Earth.<br/>So even if your previous attempts at something didn't work out, it doesn't mean that you'll never succeed.<br/><br/>Information from <a href='https://www.history.nasa.gov/SP-4210/pages/TOC.htm' target=blank>Lunar Impact: A History of Project Ranger.</a>"

In 1912, the astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered that the speed of a Cepheid variable's pulsation is related to how much light it produces. If you see a Cepheid variable pulsing slowly, but it looks very faint, you can tell that it's actually a bright star that's just located far away. (A closer star would have to produce less light to look that faint, and if it produced less light it would blink faster.) Astronomers used this relationship, called Leavitt's Law, to determine that the Andromeda Galaxy is in fact a galaxy, and not just a cloud in our own galaxy. Leavitt's Law continues to be used to make accurate measurements of cosmic distances.<br/><br/>References and further reading:<br/><a href='https://www.aavso.org/vsots_delcep'>Delta Cephei</a><br/><a href='https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/cepheids.html'>Cepheids</a><br/><a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap110701.html'>VAR!</a><br/><a href='https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~jerjen/researchprojects/cepheids/cepheids.html'>Cepheid Research Project</a><br/><a href='http://www.aavso.org/cosmic-distance-ladder'>Cosmic Distance Ladder</a>"

She brought up a really fascinating concept that I hadn't thought of before---the idea that we can detect physical traces of the cognitive and linguistic capabilities of prehistoric people. It's based on the techniques used to make stone tools. In the oldest archaeological sites, there's significant variation in the tools (and, by inference, the techniques used to make them.) But at some point, the tools and techniques become more similar. It's likely that this increased similarity was caused by the toolmakers being able to learn how to do things from each other. I think it's really cool that someone can look at an ancient stone tool and determine things about the mind of the person who made it.<br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=52804#more-52804' target=blank>Language Log interview with Cory Stade.</a><br/><a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figures?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177063' target=blank>Additional information from this PLoS One article.</a>"

Many historically-significant documents were lost in this way---but they weren't quite gone.<br/>Electrons moving at close to the speed of light produce powerful blasts of X-rays under certain conditions. Scientists working with particle accelerators thought this was a nuisance at first, but then they realized that the intense X-rays could actually be useful.<br/>And one use turned out to be retrieving the original, lost text from palimpsests. The X-rays can cause the remnants of the erased ink to fluoresce, thus allowing the missing text to be recovered.

Then Alexander Todd discovered that the DNA molecule had a repeating structure of sugar and phosphate compounds. Erwin Chargaff discovered that certain components of the DNA molecule occurred at the same proportions relative to each other. Wilkins and Franklin discovered that the molecule was a helix or spiral. Models were proposed to explain the DNA structure but didn't fit the data, Linus Pauling's proposed model can be seen lying in the background.

description = "This illustration shows the steps of the scientific method. The Thinker observes a ball falling. They form an idea based on this---that heavier objects will fall faster. They test this hypothesis with an experiment---dropping two balls. They both fall at the same speed, prompting a revision of the hypothesis. The Thinker then observes a leaf falling in an unexpected way, leading to further questions. (Objects like leaves and feathers fall more slowly on Earth due to air resistance. If you drop a hammer and feather in an airless environment, <a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap111101.html'>as astronaut David Scott did during the Apollo 15 mission,</a> they will fall at the same speed.)"

description = "This image explains the Doppler technique for spacecraft navigation, which was explained to me by Sarah Bairstow of JPL. An Earth-based ground station transmits a signal which is then retransmitted by the space vehicle. The vehicle's motion towards or away from the ground station shifts the radio frequency higher or lower because of the Doppler effect. By measuring this frequency shift the vehicle's motion can be tracked."

The ground station receives the retransmitted signal. By comparing the time a particular waveform was transmitted to the time it was received, the distance between the ground station and the vehicle can be determined."
