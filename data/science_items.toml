description = "The Story of Energy.<br/>This story starts inside the Sun, where hydrogen atoms (the oldest atoms in the universe) combine in a powerful fusion reaction to release energy. The energy then spends the next 170,000 years or so (!) making its way to the surface of the Sun. Once it reaches the surface, the light crosses the 93-million-mile void to Earth in about eight minutes. Upon arriving on Earth, some of that energy is captured by plants using chlorophyll and chemically stored as glucose, which then powers much of the planet's biosphere directly or indirectly.<br/>Poster available <a href='https://www.zazzle.com/story_of_energy_poster-228038394904112230' target=blank>here.</a><br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/' target=blank>Sun In Depth</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/specials/ocean-worlds/' target=blank>Ocean Worlds</a><br/><a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap160125.html' target=blank>Astronomy Picture of the Day</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/16667503' target=blank>Chlorophyll</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5793' target=blank>Glucose</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/280' target=blank>Carbon dioxide</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/977' target=blank>Oxygen</a><br/><a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/962' target=blank>Water</a><br/><a href='https://ssec.si.edu/stemvisions-blog/what-photosynthesis' target=blank>What Is Photosynthesis?</a>"

Lately I've been experimenting with infrared photography, and I decided to make a 3D illustration based on what the world looks like in infrared. Plants are highly reflective, basically white. The sky is black, except for clouds. Infrared photography is usually black and white, since traditional notions of color don't really work here---a color is a range of frequencies, and infrared light is made of frequencies 'below red,' so the color of any part of that spectrum is undefined since human eyes can't see it."

description = "This is an illustration about the discovery of the structure of DNA, and all of the evidence that had to be built up to make that discovery. It wasn't just a simple matter of one or two people figuring something out. First, Oswald Avery discovered that genetic information was carried by DNA---this was the foundational discovery that others built on. Then Alexander Todd discovered that the DNA molecule had a repeating structure of sugar and phosphate compounds. Erwin Chargaff discovered that certain components of the DNA molecule occurred at the same proportions relative to each other. Wilkins and Franklin discovered that the molecule was a helix or spiral. Models were proposed to explain the DNA structure but didn't fit the data, Linus Pauling's proposed model can be seen lying in the background. Finally, scientist Jerry Donohue suggested an alternate form of the molecules to use in the model, at which point Watson and Crick discovered the now-famous double helix structure.
