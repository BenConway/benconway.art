description = "This is a development of a CCA surface design project. It's a fabric pattern for making a pillow, showing two animals and their whimsical robotic counterparts. Both robots have rather unusual designs---the deer is modeled after the aesthetics of classic cameras, the rabbit is modeled after 1960s electronics lab equipment. You can see the pillows I made <a href='pillows/'>here.</a> The fabric for making the pillows is available <a href='https://www.spoonflower.com/designs/9738353-robot-animal-diy-pillow-by-benconwayart'> on Spoonflower,</a> if you order it make sure you choose Lightweight Cotton Twill as the fabric type so it will be the right size."

description = "This is a clock made from laser-cut wood, with LED lighting. I am planning to make a larger one in the future. The imagery on the clock is in a more whimsical style that's different from most of the other images on this page, but it's a style that I have worked with previously and plan to keep working with in the future."
