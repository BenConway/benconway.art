description = "This is a development of a CCA surface design project. It's a fabric pattern for making a pillow, showing two animals and their whimsical robotic counterparts. Both robots have rather unusual designs---the deer is modeled after the aesthetics of classic cameras, the rabbit is modeled after 1960s electronics lab equipment. You can see the pillows I made <a href='pillows/'>here.</a> The fabric for making the pillows is available <a href='https://www.spoonflower.com/designs/9738353-robot-animal-diy-pillow-by-benconwayart'> on Spoonflower,</a> if you order it make sure you choose Lightweight Cotton Twill as the fabric type so it will be the right size."

description = "This is a clock made from laser-cut wood, with LED lighting. I am planning to make a larger one in the future. The imagery on the clock is in a more whimsical style that's different from most of the other images on this page, but it's a style that I have worked with previously and plan to keep working with in the future."

description = "This is another CCA surface design class project. It's another project in my more whimsical style, though a bit less complex than some of the other whimsy projects I've done. See if you can spot the Erlenmeyer flask and the person wearing a hat."

description = "This was a CCA surface design class assignment to create a packaging design for fair-trade chocolate. I based my design off of the chemical structure of theobromine, the main chemical constituent of the flavor of chocolate---the hexagon-pentagon shape all over the package is the <a href='https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/theobromine'>theobromine molecule.</a> Also featured on the package is the shape of <a href='http://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:320783-2'>the cacao pod and the cacao leaf.</a> The edge of each package features some subtle elements related to the flavor of chocolate in the package. You can see other images of this project <a href='/surface/theobroma'>here.</a>"
