description = "This is an illustration of NASA's Lucy mission, which launched in October 2021 to visit the Trojan asteroids. <br/>After I decided to make an image based on that mission, I planned out which elements of the mission to highlight and how to arrange them in a clear and visually appealing way. During this process I conducted extensive research (sources below) to ensure the accuracy of each element. After creating 3D models of the vehicle, asteroids, and scientific instruments, I carefully fine-tuned the image's composition for maximum visual effect. This entire process generally takes about a week or two, and I usually have several projects of different kinds going on simultaneously.<br/><br/>References: <br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/first-mission-to-trojans-installs-final-instrument' target=blank>First Mission to Trojans Installs Final Instrument</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/first-mission-to-the-trojan-asteroids-integrates-its-second-scientific-instrument' target=blank>First Mission to Trojans Integrates Its Second Scientific Instrument</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/first-scientific-instrument-installed-on-lucy-spacecraft' target=blank>First Scientific Instrument Installed On Lucy Spacecraft</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/lucy/overview/index' target=blank>Lucy Overview</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/content/lucy-spacecraft-and-payload' target=blank>Lucy Spacecraft and Payload</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2020/lucy-spacecraft' target=blank>Lucy Spacecraft</a><br/><a href='http://lucy.swri.edu/2019/01/20/1000days.html' target=blank>1000 Days to Launch</a>"

alt = "Four outlines of people surrounded by stone tools."
description = "This image was inspired by an interview with Cory Stade on Language Log. I was really fascinated by her project of studying stone tools to gain insight into the mental processes of prehistoric people. After reading the interview, I knew I wanted to make an image based on it. I sketched out a few different compositions before settling on this one. I also made sure to research ancient stone tools (sources below) so that they would look accurate in the image. Then I created the entire picture using 3D modeling software.<br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=52804#more-52804' target=blank>Language Log interview with Cory Stade.</a><br/><a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figures?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177063' target=blank>Additional information from this PLoS One article.</a>"

description = "I created this image to show positive things that can be done to solve the climate crisis. It was a very research-heavy project, mostly based on reading the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers. I obtained some additional information from the article <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541#erlaa7541r22' target=blank> The Climate Mitigation Gap.</a><br/>I created most of the image using 3D modeling, with an ink-wash overlay for the rain effect."

description = "This is an illustration of the Earth's nitrogen, water, and carbon cycles. I decided to create a well-researched but whimsical image that showed all 3 major natural cycles. It was mostly created using 3D modeling, with some ink-wash elements. I had to adjust the image several times to make each detail scientifically accurate, but since most of the image was created digitally it was fairly easy to make the necessary modifications.<br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/fundamentals-water-cycle?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects' target=blank>The Fundamentals of the Water Cycle</a><br/><a href=' https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/diagram-nitrogen-cycle' target=blank>Diagram of the Nitrogen Cycle</a><br/><a href='https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/education/carbon_toolkit/basics.html' target=blank>Basics of the Carbon Cycle and the Greenhouse Effect</a><br/><a href='https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/hydro' target=blank>The Hydrologic Cycle</a><br/><a href='https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/22-3-prokaryotic-metabolism' target=blank>OpenStax Biology 2e</a><br/>Environmental Science for a Changing World (W.

alt = "A bunch of natural objects and scientific instruments."
description = "I created this image to answer a question I'd been pondering---'Why discover new things?' I think it has to do with seeking wonder. Finding new things out there that aren't what we're used to, and getting a new perspective on things we see every day.<br/>I planned several versions of the image before deciding on this concept and composition. It was a research-intensive project in a different way from many of my other illustrations---generally I have to do in-depth research on a specific subject. This one involved less-detailed research into a very wide variety of subjects.
