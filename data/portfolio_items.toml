description = "This is a research-heavy piece about sustainability. It's based partly on a couple of online classes I recently took (<a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-solutions?' target=blank>Climate Solutions</a> and <a href='https://www.edx.org/learn/circular-economy/delft-university-of-technology-circular-economy-an-introduction?' target=blank>Circular Economy</a>), as well as a few other sources (<a href='https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions' target=blank>Project Drawdown</a> and <a href='https://news.mit.edu/2021/lab-grown-plant-tissue-0120' target=blank>this article from MIT.</a>) My intent with this piece was to create a whimsical but factually accurate illustration bringing together as much information as possible. I made it with Blender, making extensive use of that program's new Grease Pencil 2D drawing tool."

description = "This image was based on <a href='https://news.stanford.edu/2023/05/24/food-forests-urban-farms-hold-promise-addressing-numerous-problems/' target=blank>this study from Stanford University.</a> The entire image was modeled in Blender. I had to go through a few different iterations before I was really satisfied with this piece, but thanks to the flexible nature of 3D modeling (learn more <a href='/3d_intro/' target=blank>here</a>), I was able to make all of the adjustments I needed to."

description = "This is an illustration of NASA's Lucy mission, which launched in October 2021 to visit the Trojan asteroids. <br/>After I decided to make an image based on that mission, I planned out which elements of the mission to highlight and how to arrange them in a clear and visually appealing way. During this process I conducted extensive research (sources below) to ensure the accuracy of each element. After creating 3D models of the vehicle, asteroids, and scientific instruments, I carefully fine-tuned the image's composition for maximum visual effect. This entire process generally takes about a week or two, and I usually have several projects of different kinds going on simultaneously.<br/><br/>References: <br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/first-mission-to-trojans-installs-final-instrument' target=blank>First Mission to Trojans Installs Final Instrument</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/first-mission-to-the-trojan-asteroids-integrates-its-second-scientific-instrument' target=blank>First Mission to Trojans Integrates Its Second Scientific Instrument</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/first-scientific-instrument-installed-on-lucy-spacecraft' target=blank>First Scientific Instrument Installed On Lucy Spacecraft</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/lucy/overview/index' target=blank>Lucy Overview</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/content/lucy-spacecraft-and-payload' target=blank>Lucy Spacecraft and Payload</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2020/lucy-spacecraft' target=blank>Lucy Spacecraft</a><br/><a href='http://lucy.swri.edu/2019/01/20/1000days.html' target=blank>1000 Days to Launch</a>"

alt = "Four outlines of people surrounded by stone tools."
description = "This image was inspired by an interview with Cory Stade on Language Log. I was really fascinated by her project of studying stone tools to gain insight into the mental processes of prehistoric people. After reading the interview, I knew I wanted to make an image based on it. I sketched out a few different compositions before settling on this one. I also made sure to research ancient stone tools (sources below) so that they would look accurate in the image. Then I created the entire picture using 3D modeling software.<br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=52804#more-52804' target=blank>Language Log interview with Cory Stade.</a><br/><a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figures?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177063' target=blank>Additional information from this PLoS One article.</a>"

description = "I created this image to show positive things that can be done to solve the climate crisis. It was a very research-heavy project, mostly based on reading the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers. I obtained some additional information from the article <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541#erlaa7541r22' target=blank> The Climate Mitigation Gap.</a><br/>I created most of the image using 3D modeling, with an ink-wash overlay for the rain effect."
