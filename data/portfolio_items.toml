description = "This is an illustration of NASA's Lucy mission, which launched in October 2021 to visit the Trojan asteroids. After deciding to make an image based on that mission, I began planning out which elements of the mission to highlight and how to arrange them in a clear and visually appealing way. I also conducted extensive research (sources below) to ensure the accuracy of each element. After modeling the vehicle, asteroids, and scientific instruments in Blender, I carefully fine-tuned the position of each element in the image for maximum visual impact. My entire process of making an image generally takes about a week, and I can work on several projects in parallel.<br/><br/>References: <br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/first-mission-to-trojans-installs-final-instrument' target=blank>First Mission to Trojans Installs Final Instrument</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/first-mission-to-the-trojan-asteroids-integrates-its-second-scientific-instrument' target=blank>First Mission to Trojans Integrates Its Second Scientific Instrument</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/first-scientific-instrument-installed-on-lucy-spacecraft' target=blank>First Scientific Instrument Installed On Lucy Spacecraft</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/lucy/overview/index' target=blank>Lucy Overview</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/content/lucy-spacecraft-and-payload' target=blank>Lucy Spacecraft and Payload</a><br/><a href='https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2020/lucy-spacecraft' target=blank>Lucy Spacecraft</a><br/><a href='http://lucy.swri.edu/2019/01/20/1000days.html' target=blank>1000 Days to Launch</a>"

alt = "Four outlines of people surrounded by stone tools."
description = "This image was inspired by an interview with Cory Stade on Language Log. She brought up a really fascinating concept that I hadn't thought of before---the idea that we can detect physical traces of the cognitive and linguistic capabilities of prehistoric people. After reading the interview, I knew I wanted to make an image based on it. I sketched out a few different compositions before settling on this one. I also made sure to research ancient stone tools (references below.) Then I created the entire image in Blender.<br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=52804#more-52804' target=blank>Language Log interview with Cory Stade.</a><br/><a href='https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figures?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177063' target=blank>Additional information from this PLoS One article.</a>"

alt = "Better Future"
description = "I created this image to show positive things that can be done to solve the environmental crisis. It was a very research-heavy project, mostly based on reading the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers. I obtained some additional information from the article <a href='https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541#erlaa7541r22' target=blank> The Climate Mitigation Gap.</a><br/>I modeled most of the image in Blender and then created an ink-wash overlay for the rain effect, which I scanned and digitally integrated into the image."

description = "This is an illustration of the Earth's nitrogen, water, and carbon cycles. I had been considering making an image like this since taking an environmental science class years ago. I decided to create a well-researched but whimsical image that showed all 3 major natural cycles in a single image. I modeled it using Blender, with some traditionally-drawn (ink-wash) elements. This allowed me to make all the necessary adjustments to the image to ensure accuracy.<br/><br/>References:<br/><a href='https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/fundamentals-water-cycle?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects' target=blank>The Fundamentals of the Water Cycle</a><br/><a href=' https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/diagram-nitrogen-cycle' target=blank>Diagram of the Nitrogen Cycle</a><br/><a href='https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/education/carbon_toolkit/basics.html' target=blank>Basics of the Carbon Cycle and the Greenhouse Effect</a><br/><a href='https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/hydro' target=blank>The Hydrologic Cycle</a><br/><a href='https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/22-3-prokaryotic-metabolism' target=blank>OpenStax Biology 2e</a><br/>Environmental Science for a Changing World (W.

alt = "A bunch of natural objects and scientific instruments."
description = "I created this image as a response to the question 'Why discover new things?' I think it has to do with seeking wonder. Finding new things out there that aren't what we're used to, and getting a new perspective on things we see every day.<br/>I planned several versions of the image before deciding that this approach would be the best. I then created the image in Blender. It was a research-heavy project in a different way from many of my other projects---my projects typically involve in-depth research on specific subjects. This one involved less-detailed research into a very wide variety of subjects. I obtained information and reference images from the following sources:<br/><a href='https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/gallery/southern-california-bight' target=blank>NOAA Deep Sea Coral Data</a><br/><a href='https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/subs/kraken2/kraken2.html' target=blank>Kraken 2</a><br/><a href='https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/subs/alvin/alvin.html' target=blank>Alvin</a><br/><a href='https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/4-3-eukaryotic-cells' target=blank>OpenStax Biology 2e</a><br/><a href='https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/universe?subselect=Target%3AGalaxy+NGC+3310%3A' target=blank>Starburst Galaxy NGC3310</a><br/><a href='https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing?source=junocam' target=blank>JunoCam</a>"
